You can then pinpoint their weaknesses&nbsp;to disrupt them or ensure you know as much about them as possible in order to completely dismantle&nbsp;them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\"><strong>Why does Network Analysis matter?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full clear-top clear-bottom\"><img width=\"1422\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis_Slide-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10882\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis_Slide-3.png 1422w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis_Slide-3-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis_Slide-3-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis_Slide-3-768x432.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1422px) 100vw, 1422px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#009ca6\"><strong>Use Network Analysis to understand both the wider threat landscape and what poses the greatest risk to your brands and consumers.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The traditional approach to brand protection has been to target listings,&nbsp;posts&nbsp;and individual websites.&nbsp;Historically, brands have tackled these one at a time unaware of how they fit into the wider landscape online.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s likely that&nbsp;you\u2019ve been overwhelmed with hundreds, if not thousands of listings and posts, that reappear not long after you have taken then offline.&nbsp;This \u2018data dump\u2019, which relies on you and your team sifting through&nbsp;rows of information, is simply too much to help you understand how to tackle the problem in the most effective way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By&nbsp;focusing&nbsp;on the way that bad actors use multiple channels to get to consumers, you can start to understand the best way to disrupt their routes to market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#009ca6\"><strong>Network Analysis enables you to make the best use of resources to impact these networks and protect your brands.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teams tasked with protecting their brands never have enough time,&nbsp;money&nbsp;or people to tackle every problem out there.&nbsp;Given these constraints, you need to be able to make good decisions about how you tackle these networks both online and offline.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many brands will look to Network Analysis as a way to connect both online and offline, as they know that offline cases can&nbsp;be lengthy and expensive.&nbsp;Tying together both online and offline intelligence to decide how to tackle these networks as quickly as possible and with&nbsp;efficient spend of money and time is critical.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\"><strong>What do you need?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>1. Data<\/strong> \u2013 &nbsp;You&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;collect, evaluate and&nbsp;collate data.&nbsp; This might be data that you collect about threats online, through searching&nbsp;the web regularly scanning for threats, but it might also be your offline data, gathered as part of your investigations into bad actors.&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenge to overcome here is the scale of the data you might be dealing with.&nbsp; The more threats that you face, the bigger the challenge.&nbsp; That\u2019s where our second essential point comes in\u2026.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul start=\"2\"><li><strong>2. Technology&nbsp;<\/strong>\u2013&nbsp;You\u2019ll need to leverage technology to do this kind of data processing at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;It\u2019s&nbsp;not only about gathering the data, but also about making sure it\u2019s relevant, cleaned up and can be linked together and visualized.&nbsp; As they say, a picture paints a thousand&nbsp;words&nbsp;and this is definitely true here.&nbsp; Being able to see the network as a web of relationships, helps to drive your analysis and show where you have intelligence gaps and further&nbsp;investigation to do.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul start=\"3\"><li><strong>3. People <\/strong>\u2013 or more specifically, expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology and data can get you so far in understanding what you\u2019re dealing with but inevitably you will need online and offline experts to help you&nbsp;discover more intelligence, gather evidence and tackle the network as it evolves&nbsp;in response to your actions&nbsp;and&nbsp;is hopefully dismantled and destroyed.&nbsp; This expertise can help you to understand who to target&nbsp;and&nbsp;where to enforce&nbsp;to get the result you want.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">What are the applications of Network Analysis?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Without Network Analysis,&nbsp;your team will be looking at a mass of data about what\u2019s happening to your brand without any indication as to how these accounts relate to each&nbsp;other.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we used Network Analysis to understand this data, then we would see these networks before we started enforcement and could decide&nbsp;on the&nbsp;tactics&nbsp;we want to use to remove it.&nbsp;The best option would be to take down all 3 domains plus the&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;page in one go.&nbsp;This is not only efficient as we won\u2019t play whack-a-mole with the various sites and social media&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;but it also has a bigger impact on the bad actor behind this network. Taking down all of their channels at once makes it harder for them to recover.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These examples are simplified for the purpose of this tutorial video, but provide a glimpse of the potential&nbsp;applications for Network Analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-summary\"><strong>Summary<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Network Analysis give brands&nbsp;insight&nbsp;into the&nbsp;different&nbsp;networks&nbsp;that are&nbsp;impacting&nbsp;their business&nbsp;and consumers.&nbsp; By laying out these&nbsp;networks&nbsp;and enabling them to be compared&nbsp;with each&nbsp;other, we can&nbsp;drive&nbsp;enforcement&nbsp;and investigations&nbsp;in a more informed&nbsp;and impactful way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brands are empowered to&nbsp;make judgements about where to focus their attention&nbsp;depending on their own specific priorities for their business and consumers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Network Analysis provides the&nbsp;intelligence vital for brands to be able to have the impact they want&nbsp;when protecting themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe your brand is being exploited by the bad actor networks, consider the right technical and strategic solution for your Brand Protection program.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set up a session with one of our experts to&nbsp;discuss the outcomes you want to achieve&nbsp;for&nbsp;your brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"cta-button align-left\">\n    <a href=\"\/expert\" title=\"Talk&#x20;to&#x20;an&#x20;Expert\"  class=\"btn btn--primary caret-btn\">Talk to an Expert<\/a>\n<\/div>\n\n<section class=\"product-cta\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"product\">\n            <div class=\"product__inner\">\n                <div>\n                    <h2>Whiteboard Tutorial: Bad Actor Networks<\/h2>\n                    <p>Bad Actor Networks pose a high risk to brands online, diverting e-commerce revenues and eroding consumer trust by infiltrating channels across the globe.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn this tutorial, we explore \u2018Bad Actor Networks\u2019 in more detail and look at why they often pose the greatest threat to your brand versus individual infringers.
