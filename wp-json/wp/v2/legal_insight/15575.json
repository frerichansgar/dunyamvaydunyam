The text no longer refers to the requirement of graphic representation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as we will see in this article, the removal of such a requirement has, taking the French example, not been accompanied by a multiplication of non-traditional trademark filings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In France, the 2015 Directive was transposed in the Ordinance of 13 November 2019[3], which came into force on the date of entry into force of Decree of 9 December 2019[4].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, the IP Code while listing signs that could be registered as a trademark provided that they are \u201c<em>distinctive, lawful, available, and in the public domain\u201d.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new IP Code has simplified the trademark definition as <em>&#8220;a sign used to distinguish the goods or services of one natural or legal person from those of other natural or legal persons.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Such a sign must be capable of being represented in the national trademark register in such a way as to enable any person to determine precisely and clearly the subject matter of the protection conferred on its owner&#8221;[5]<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the new provisions of the IP Code allow signs that are neither verbal nor figurative, such as sound, multimedia or motion trademarks, to be registered as trademarks as soon as the sign is <em>&#8220;clear, precise, distinct, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective&#8221;[6].&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following this coming into effect, the French national trademark office has analysed, depending on the type of trademark, the number of applications and registrations of non-traditional trademarks and has tried to identify a trend in the registration of non-traditional trademarks[7]. Hereinafter, we proposed organising this analysis in the form of a board. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it is, these figures do not yet make it possible to identify a trend in the registration of non-traditional trademarks. Still, one may note although half of the atypical trademarks filed within the last year before the INPI[8] have successfully been registered, the success of such trademarks is still relative. This is because uncertainties remain regarding this new legislation, particularly with regard to the assessment of the distinctive character of such trademarks or comparison method with identical or similar trademarks. These uncertainties are reinforced by the fact that there is not yet any case law interpreting the new IP Code provisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New issues will arise, for example the application of comparison methods to assess similarities with a non-traditional brand, our adaptation to the fight against online infringement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, on the subject of non-traditional trademarks, things could really change with the publication, in April 2021, of an EUIPO communication entitled <em>New types of trademarks &#8211; Examination of formal requirements and grounds for refusal and invalidity<\/em>, which should provide clarification to applicants on the criteria for accepting new types of trademarks, reinforce the legal predictability of these titles and ultimately initiate a change in practice towards more filings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Access the original article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uggc.com\/en\/trademark-package-assessing-the-filing-of-non-traditional-trademarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"heading-branded\">Applications for non-traditional trademarks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Before the INPI<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Before the EUIPO<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Sound trademarks<\/strong><\/td><td>7 sound trademarks have been registered since 11 December 2019 and published in the BOPI; 1 trademark has been registered (on 27 November 2020); Only 1 trademark has been registered in the form of the image of a musical staff in JPEG format; the others have been registered in MP3 format.<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Motion trademarks<\/strong><\/td><td>5 motion trademarks have been registered since 11 December 2019 and published in the BOPI; 2 motion trademarks have been registered, on September 18 and October 9, 2020; Please also note that only 1 trademark has been registered as a series of sequential still images in JPEG format; the others have been registered in MP4 format.<\/td><td>110 applications for motion trademarks, of which 68 were registered.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Multimedia trademarks<\/strong><\/td><td>13 multimedia trademarks have been registered since 11 December 2019 and published in the BOPI; 8 trademarks have been registered (between 16 October and 27 November 2020);<\/td><td>51 multimedia trademark applications, 38 of which have been registered.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Hologram trademarks<\/strong><\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>3 hologram trademark applications, 2 of which have been registered.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[1] OHMI, 11\/02\/1999: smell of freshly cut grass registered as a trademark for a tennis ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[2] Article 3 of the Directive (UE) 2015\/2436<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[3] See: https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/loda\/id\/JORFTEXT000039373287\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[4] See: https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/loda\/id\/JORFTEXT000039467798\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[5] Article L. 711-1 of the IP Code<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[6] Article R. 711-1 of the IP Code<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[7] For instance, the most commonly used classes of goods and services are 9, 35, 38 and 41.
