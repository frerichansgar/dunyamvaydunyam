Increasingly the issue of counterfeits is becoming a problem for brands, even as Google tries to expand its advertising domain and facilitate more commerce.<\/h2>\n<p>In 2017, the former head sports apparel brand Fanatics Dennis Goedegebuure\u00a0noticed\u00a0that organic search results for sports jerseys were producing a number of counterfeit products.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be much better if Google would take proactive action towards the danger of counterfeit sites polluting the SERPs and defrauding customers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s in the best interest of the users to keep these counterfeit sellers out of the search results, so why not white list the official sellers of licensed NFL jerseys, and give these sites top rankings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Today, an identical web search returns the same questionable organic results.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last year, U.K. apparel company Superdry has had upwards of \u00a3160 million ($207 million) of counterfeit products removed from various online channels.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a significant problem,\u201d said James Sweeting, Superdry\u2019s head of legal. With Google, it\u2019s especially gnarly because many people use it to discover information, and may not approach it with the same skepticism as, say, a standalone online marketplace. \u201cConsumers could be misled,\u201d said Sweeting. \u201cThe impact this has on the brand \u2014 whether it\u2019s the brand\u2019s reputation or lost sales \u2014 is significant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Google, given its status as a supposed neutral search engine, has been allergic to widespread crackdowns on others\u2019 content. It thinks of itself as an index to the open web. At the same time, the company is making increased inroads in the commerce space and is increasingly asking brands to invest more in its updated and ever-expanding platform; a systemic problem pertaining to counterfeit products could easily erode trust. While Google\u2019s recourse seems to be to refuse to crack down on counterfeit content in Search unless legal means are sought, this problem could have a big impact on its brand perception if it continues to try and control more parts of the online experience.<\/p>\n<p>A new\u00a0report\u00a0from brand protection software provider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/how-and-why-search-engines-must-take-responsibility-for-tackling-counterfeiters\/\">Incopro highlights how counterfeit items are rampant on Google search results<\/a>. The company researched the problem by performing a series of online searches about branded items and categorizing whether the results linked to pages hawking fake goods. It used six examples of a branded product \u2014 for example: for pharmaceuticals, Incopro searched for the drug Bactrin; for children\u2019s products it searched for a specific baby teether. In all, up to 60% of the results Incopro found were for \u201cwebsites and other locations that offer consumer products that are either counterfeit or otherwise infringe brand owner rights,\u201d the report said.<\/p>\n<p>Counterfeit is not a new problem \u2014 ditto policing online spaces for bad actors. But other digital platforms \u2014 like Amazon and Facebook \u2014 have historically taken steps to combat the issue. Amazon, for example, has made\u00a0multiple pledges\u00a0to crack down on counterfeit listings. The problem, however, still exist; A\u00a0recent report\u00a0from the analytics firm Ghost Data showed that Instagram was teeming with fake luxury items, and the trade group the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA)\u00a0called out\u00a0Amazon earlier this month for selling counterfeit goods.<\/p>\n<p>Reached for comment about Incopro\u2019s report, a Google spokesperson provided the following statement: \u201cThe methodology described in this report ignores how the large majority of people use Search, and therefore yields very misleading results. Search is an index of the web, and the sites in Google Search results are controlled by those sites\u2019 webmasters, not by Google.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Counterfeit results on a search engine certainly present a prickly situation. While the company does crack down on individual counterfeit items for sale in its Shopping platform, brands rely on organic search to both drive sales and name recognition. As Modern Retail\u00a0reported last August, the technology giant has been making strides to keep people performing searches on its own website. For instance, people are able to make transactions within Google\u2019s own properties \u2014 and often Google will aggregate integral information at the top of search results. This update alone has caused brands to completely rethink their overall Google strategies. \u201cGoogle knows that there\u2019s major opportunity [for shopping],\u201d Ryan Edwards, svp of integrated search at the Tombras Group,\u00a0said to Modern Retail earlier this month.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect solution,\u201d said Tory Lynne Gray, a senior SEO strategist at the e-commerce marketing agency Inflow. Brands dealing with counterfeit organic search results are often left in a lurch if they don\u2019t have direct access to Google. What they would have to do is launch their own offensive to both boost the brand\u2019s profile and make sure customers are aware of the counterfeit issue. When Google is refusing to take down a fake result, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of options.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For some, the onus of action may be contacting the offenders themselves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As Incopro CEO Simon Baggs said, contacting domains selling counterfeit goods is a \u201cslightly pointless process.\u201d If a person goes after an individual website, \u201cthe host will either not take it down or move to a new host.\u201d As a result, the best way for brands to protect their IP is to ask Google to de-index the sites.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google currently treats the issue as one pertaining to U.S. legal obstacles. For example, thanks to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which criminalized certain copyright infringements, Google will respond to those sorts of complaints. Other countries have laws that would prohibit some of Google\u2019s Search results from being indexed, and yet the company has yet to act. \u201cIt\u2019s a misconception to think of [this problem] just in terms of what US legislation requires,\u201d Baggs said. \u201cGoogle is a global service.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to Sweeting, Google will sometimes respond to his inquiries, but only on a one-off basis. The big problem, however, is that Google will never completely de-index a counterfeit site, and instead just lower its rank. Not only that, said Sweeting, but \u201cGoogle will only do these things reactively.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As the Google platform continues to expand its Shopping capabilities and try to woo more brands to the platform, it may be forced to crack down on the counterfeit problem in more serious ways. \u201cThe magnitude of the problem has increased,\u201d said Sweeting, and so too have the technologies deployed to help fight online counterfeits.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an evolving problem,\u201d he went on, \u201cand we are having to adapt.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article in ModernRetail <a href=\"https:\/\/www.modernretail.co\/platforms\/how-googles-counterfeit-search-problem-could-hurt-its-commerce-ambitions\/\">here<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2291,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How Google\u2019s counterfeit search problem could hurt its commerce ambitions | ModernRetail - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/how-googles-counterfeit-search-problem-could-hurt-its-commerce-ambitions-modernretail\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"How Google\u2019s counterfeit search problem could hurt its commerce ambitions | ModernRetail\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"For many brands, Googling their companies often turns up counterfeit listings, via bogus websites and fraudulent marketplaces.
