It used software to search for brands or products, replicating the way consumers typically use the internet to find suppliers of specific goods.<\/p>\n<p>The company said it routinely searches for these instances of brand misuse on behalf of the brands it works with. It has found millions of infringements taking place online daily. Some of those brands include Oreo, Dr. Martens, Trident, Halls, and belVita.<\/p>\n<p>These infringements involve offering consumers fake products and services. The offers are made on well-established platforms and through web sites and social media.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the research found 26% of the potentially harmful web sites in the top three search results. Some 47.3% of traffic to these websites comes from consumers using search terms that specify a brand or particular product.<\/p>\n<p>Research from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0published in March 2019 estimates the value of trade in counterfeit goods at $509 billion. While this is the equivalent of 3.3% of world trade, consumer safety is the pressing concern, according to the report.<\/p>\n<p>In the white goods sector, for example, a search for refrigerator filters using reference terms directed consumers toward a website selling counterfeit goods.<\/p>\n<p>In the children\u2019s products category, a third of the search results for a \u201cComotomo teether\u201d featured potentially harmful products that misuse the company\u2019s trademark. And in the pharmaceutical, six in 10 of Google\u2019s first-page results following searches for the antibiotic Bactrim were for locations the study deemed unlawful.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article in the MediaPost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mediapost.com\/publications\/article\/342255\/data-shows-more-then-half-of-google-searches-lead.html\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2280,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
