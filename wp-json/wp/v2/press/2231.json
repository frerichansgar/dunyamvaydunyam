In our latest edition, we look at a new online trademark and designs service launched by the Swedish IP Office, the Babybel wax-coating trademark being\u00a0invalidated, Malaysia\u2019s deputy health minister praising plain packaging, scammers filing \u201cfake trademarks\u201d to hijack Instagram accounts, and much more. Coverage this time from Trevor Little (TL), Adam Houldsworth (AH), Bridget Diakun (BD) and Tim Lince (TJL).<\/p>\n<h3>Market radar:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Conspiracy? Problems raised in registered marks in Venezuela\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013 An article\u00a0in local <a href=\"https:\/\/www.caracaschronicles.com\/2019\/02\/13\/want-to-register-a-brand-in-venezuela-gotta-pay-in-petros\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Venezuelan media<\/a>\u00a0has detailed the ongoing challenges that US companies are having in registering their brands in Venezuela. According to one unnamed lawyer: \u201cThe majority of our clients are US-based companies, and they have to pay taxes there. They can\u2019t pay anything in petros, directly or indirectly, because doing so could be considered \u2018conspiracy\u2019 under US law so, in practice, you can\u2019t use them to register trademarks and patents. For the moment, we have no solution for this.\u201d The article claims that, for IP firms in Venezuela, most clients are international due to the current domestic crisis in the country. The issue began following a March 2018 order from US President Donald Trump, which prohibitted US purchases of the Venezuelan cryptocurrency (the currency required to file at the local IP office). Furthermore, due to these question marks about how US companies can protect their brands in Venezuela, the International Trademark Association is \u201ccarrying out meetings to discuss possible solutions\u201d. For rights holders, this is one to watch out for.\u00a0(TJL)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quarter of British people purchased fakes in last year\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013 <strong>New research from Incopro has found that 25% of UK consumers \u201chave admitted to knowingly buying at least one counterfeit product in the last 12 months\u201d<\/strong>. According to\u00a0a <a href=\"https:\/\/dealersupport.co.uk\/a-quarter-of-brits-purchased-counterfeit-goods-in-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">summary of the findings<\/a>, just 20% of people state that they have reported to an online marketplace if they unknowingly purchased fake goods \u2013 suggesting more work needs to go into raising awareness about the reporting function on e-retailers.\u00a0(TJL)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Malaysia could implement plain packaging\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013 Just\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldtrademarkreview.com\/anti-counterfeiting\/plain-packaging-passed-singapore-cat-photo-trademarks-and-us-senate-ip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a week after<\/a>\u00a0nation neighbour Singapore passed a plain packaging bill for tobacco products, Malaysia is reportedly considering implementing a similar measure. According\u00a0to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.freemalaysiatoday.com\/category\/nation\/2019\/02\/13\/after-smoking-ban-putrajaya-mulls-plain-packaging-for-cigarettes\/?utm_medium=push&amp;utm_source=webpush\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Free Malaysia Today<\/a>,\u00a0the country\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Dr Lee Boon Chye spoke about how plain packaging could curb smoking in Malaysia. \u201cThis has been done in countries like Australia, and the results can be seen,\u201d he said. \u201c[Industry players] will cite reasons like the cost of the exercise and how it will affect their business or the intellectual property rights of tobacco companies. We are considering it. There is no timeline set. We have to study the matter and hold talks with stakeholders.\u201d It appears, then, that the dominoes are continuing to fall when it comes to tobacco plain packaging.\u00a0(TJL)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scammers filings \u201cfake trademarks\u201d in bid to hijack Instagram accounts<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 In an article\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/amp\/en_us\/article\/zma3w4\/scammers-fake-trademarks-steal-instagram-accounts?fbclid=IwAR0iLaUvf_rWESs8HPPXfs65SjlKf_V_x_inrjNteROjJW0PWlk_54yHo8k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vice<\/a>, reports of shady behaviour to take over Instagram have been reported. Specifically, scammers are reportedly \u201ccreating fake companies and trademarks to convince Instagram they should be the legitimate owner of a username in question\u201d. This technique is being used to obtain control over potentially valuable Instagram accounts, and this activity is apparently ongoing and discussed on Instagram account trademark forums. For both Instagram and the USPTO (where a majority of these so-called \u2018fake trademarks; are being filed), suggestions of fraudulent activity should be a concern.\u00a0(TJL)<\/p>\n<h3>Legal radar:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Butlers in the Buff stops rival firm using its brand \u2013<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>UK company Butlers in the Buff, well-known for providing semi-naked men to serve food and drink at hen parties and other events, has struck a favourable settlement with competitor company Bufflers Entertainment over the use of its trademark. As well as agreeing to pay damages and costs, Bufflers has said it will reference to \u201cButlers in the Buff\u201d from its website and marketing materials, it has been\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bmmagazine.co.uk\/news\/butlers-in-the-buff-wins-landmark-brand-trademark-case\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported<\/a>. Its CEO Adam Davey said the company had not been aware that the name had been trademarked and had complied with the rights holder every step of the way.\u00a0(AH)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Babybel\u2019s wax-coating mark invalidated \u2013<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The UKIPO has\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipo.gov.uk\/t-challenge-decision-results\/o08619.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cancelled<\/a>\u00a0Babybel\u2019s trademark for the wax-coating of its cheese product. This follows a challenge by supermarket chain Sainsbury, which argued that the colours displayed in the application\u2019s pictorial representation of the mark (which shows the colours white and fuschia) do not correspond to its verbal description (of a red mark) meaning that the overall representation of the trademark is not clear, precise or intelligible. Head of Trademarks Tribunal Allan James opined that in this case, in which the colour of the mark is important, \u201cdefining the colour with the broad description \u2018red\u2019 is insufficiently precise to satisfy the requirement for a graphical representation of the trade mark\u201d.\u00a0(AH)<\/p>\n<h3>Office radar:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>IP Australia\u2019s AI platform \u201cmore than just a chatbot\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 The director of digital services, innovation and technology at IP Australia, Craig Stokes, spoke at an event this week about the huge success of its AI-powered chatbot \u2018Alex\u2019. Launched 2.5 years ago, the bot answers customer queries on the IP Australia website and is also able to perform more advanced functions. In an article on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/ip-australias-alex-is-more-than-just-a-chatbot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ZDNet<\/a>, Stokes revealed that Alex now answers 40% of all of IP Australia\u2019s customer interactions, reducing the staff need to answer such queries. Indeed, even more impressively, it has drastically reduced the number of phone enquiries that the office receives \u2013 from 12,000 calls a month in 2016 to 5,000 a month now \u201cand still dropping\u201d. He further explained: \u201cI&#8217;m not saying Alex was the only intervention we had, but it was one of the main ones. The value for money and return on investment is quite good.&#8221; As well as reducing phone queries, Stokes spoke of other advantages as well: \u201cOne of the biggest values out of having a chatbot is that it shows off where you don&#8217;t have information, where processes are broken, what you&#8217;re doing wrong. Even if the chatbot can&#8217;t answer it, you&#8217;ve captured that data, you can analyse it, and go back to it.&#8221; It appears, then, that IP Australia is seeing real advantages from having an AI-powered chatbot on its website. Surprisingly, relatively few other IP offices have such a tool implemented (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldtrademarkreview.com\/anti-counterfeiting\/finnish-ip-office-releases-chatbot-alibaba-owned-marketplace-signs-mou-and\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Finnish IP office<\/a>\u00a0launched one late last year) \u2013 but evidence suggests that an investment in a chatbot could be worth considering for registries.\u00a0(TJL)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sweden launches new trademark and designs online service\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013 The Swedish Patent and Registration Office (PRV) has launched a new service that allows users to file trademark and design oppositions online. The new digital is part of the Software Package Front Office, a tool developed under the auspices of the European Cooperation Fund, and it is the 15th new e-service the PRV has launched in the past 12 months in cooperation with the EUIPO.
