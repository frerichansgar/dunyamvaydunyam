He opened by observing that in four days, on 24 May, it will be the 175th anniversary of the first telegraph ever sent in the US, by Samuel Morse. Moore observed: \u201cThe first message was \u2018what hath God wrought?\u2019. When you look at the internet today and infringement, I\u2019ve been thinking that very thought. What a prescient thing to say back then.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A few years ago, then, the company noted that online counterfeiting was having an impact and Moore decided to focus on one brand on one platform \u2013 specifically Uno on Amazon.com. <strong>Over a two month period, working with Incopro, more than 2,000 listings were taken down \u2013 with the ROI quickly becoming clear:<\/strong><br \/> \u201cAs we continued to take down infringement, people were driven to our product and we could tell that our profitability was going up \u2013 there was a clear effect. And the business was thrilled.\u201d<br \/> The programme was then expanded to include the Power Wheels brand, with data gathered on the top five infringers. \u201cWe could then decide what to do. Take down? Sue? Some we sued and we won a good amount of money, which went back to our programme,\u201d Moore said. The takeaway? Sometimes you need to speculate to accumulate, but business will be supportive if the ROI can be tracked.
