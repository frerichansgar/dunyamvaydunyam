Notably, the rise of social media has removed this sense of secrecy, instead creating buzz around the designs on show and transforming the catwalk into a powerful consumer marketing opportunity \u2013 crucially, one demanding instant gratification.<\/p>\n<p>Traditionally, fashion brands begin designing a collection six months before a show debut, and then the clothes typically aren\u2019t available to consumers for another six months. Consequently, this means brands are all too often ill-equipped to translate the social media buzz into concrete sales.<\/p>\n<p>This explains why, last year, luxury fashion behemoths\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/uk.burberry.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Burberry<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tomford.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tom Ford<\/a>\u00a0unveiled their first \u2018see now, buy now\u2019 shows. In turn, this heralds a new age for the industry whereby customers can now purchase \u2018seasonless\u2019 garments \u2013 rather than Spring\/Summer and Autumn\/Winter, collections are simply called \u2018September\u2019 and \u2018February\u2019 \u2013 as soon as they appear on the runway. Making this move enables fashion brands to capitalise on consumer interest as soon as it appears on their collective Instagram feeds.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, this may not be the whole story behind the switch. For decades now, luxury fashion brands have been targets for criminal counterfeits and high-street copycats. Previously, criminals were restricted to selling fake products on the streets, but now the internet has completely revolutionised their operations. As well as enjoying multiple platforms to sell on \u2013 chiefly domains, online marketplaces, and social media \u2013 fraudsters have also increased their audience and the speed at which they can sell.<\/p>\n<h3>The New Digital Age<\/h3>\n<p>Technology has succeeded in expanding legitimate methods for brands to sell their goods to consumers; unfortunately, this also means counterfeit networks are swiftly taking advantage of these innovations. There have been hefty increases in Facebook advertising being used to drive traffic to domains belonging to illegal counterfeiters, as well as to promote goods. Social networks, meanwhile, are also increasingly experimenting with selling directly through their platforms \u2013 as just one example, Facebook rolled out Facebook Marketplace to its mobile users in 2016, and Instagram is currently trialling a \u2018Shop Now\u2019 button, enabling customers to buy directly through posted images. Considering that counterfeiting is such a pervasive problem, it\u2019s not difficult to spot the possible pitfalls of this new digital age.<\/p>\n<h3>Minimising Opportunity<\/h3>\n<p>By making their designs instantly available to consumers, high-end fashion brands are able to minimise the window in which other can copy their designs and get them to market. With this new \u2018Instabuy\u2019 model, the lead-time for maximising the media buzz has been dramatically reduced, and so counterfeiters must contend with missing out on heightened consumer anticipation. The situation is the same for high-street chains, which seek inspiration straight from the catwalk in order to make and sell their own designs.<\/p>\n<p>Certainly, for brands that adopt these new \u2018seasonless\u2019 timescales, there are many lessons to be learned, entailing a complete overhaul of how product and supply chains are managed in relation to PR and marketing efforts. Ultimately, however, the payoff in terms of safeguarding brand authenticity could be momentous \u2013 but only for fashion brands bold enough to take the leap into this brave new world.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>To view the original article in The Luxury Law Alliance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.luxurylawalliance.com\/news-features\/instabuy-the-power-and-pitfalls-of-instant-shopping\/801271865\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>click here<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2193,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
