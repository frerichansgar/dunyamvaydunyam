Amazon has since removed the product.<\/p>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t the first such incident.\u00a0On Sunday,\u00a0Auschwitz-Birkenau State museum appealed to Amazon to remove offensive Christmas merchandise, which included an Auschwitz bottle opener and a Birkenau &#8220;massacre&#8221; mouse pad.<\/p>\n<p>The Holocaust site has become a symbol of Nazi Germany&#8217;s genocide of six million European Jews, with one million killed at the camp between 1940 to 1945. Amazon says it has since\u00a0removed the products.<br \/> Why do offensive products appear on Amazon?<br \/> The online retail giant says it spent $400m (\u00a3309) in 2018 protecting its stores and blocked three billion suspect listings.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon tells sellers that it will not allow the sale of \u201cproducts that promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance or promote organisations with such views\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>But while Amazon&#8217;s systems do flag suspect products and it has humans who monitor product listings, its approach remains \u201chighly reactive\u201d, one industry expert told The Telegraph.<\/p>\n<p>Its efforts apparently continue to fall short of stopping a surge of apparently automated products that spread hateful images.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, a report by the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0into Amazon Marketplace claimed that the site had \u201cevolved like a flea market\u201d, exercising\u00a0limited oversight over items listed by millions of anonymous third-party sellers.<\/p>\n<p>Third-party sellers accounted for around\u00a060pc\u00a0of merchandise sales in 2018, but often it&#8217;s difficult to know that the products are from a third-party and not Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany third-party items the Journal examined were listed as Amazon Prime eligible and sold through the Fulfillment by Amazon program, which generally ships items from Amazon warehouses in Amazon-branded boxes,\u201d the Journal reported.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon also encourages anyone to sign up and start selling straightaway, relying on automated tools to flag anything suspicious, which means many offensive products can be listed without human vetting.<br \/> Profits from hate-filled products<br \/> The Amazon account\u00a0selling the Auschwitz Christmas trees\u00a0remained online on Monday morning. Its page is filled with spam-like listings, which experts say are likely generated by a search engine-pleasing algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>If you are after a Christmas tree star featuring a tourist spots from Madrid to Mykonos or even a\u00a0field in \u201cPreston, UK\u201d you can probably find one on its account.<\/p>\n<p>In response to the Auschwitz listings, an Amazon spokesman said: \u201cAll sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action, including potential removal of their account. The products in question have been removed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But it is not the first time third-party sellers have tried to flood Amazon with Holocaust images for profit \u2013\u00a0and it is not clear how many are simply spamming Amazon with listings, or intentionally trying to sell offensive goods.<\/p>\n<p>Accounts selling &#8220;The Eternal Jew\u201d cartoons on \u00a318 children&#8217;s hoodies, T-shirts and even cushions were found by The Telegraph in minutes.<\/p>\n<p>An Amazon spokesman said the offending products had now been removed. The account has since been suspended.<\/p>\n<p>One of the accounts selling the products, Rugzt, was previously flagged by\u00a0Jewish News\u00a0in August, but remained online for months and continued to sell its offensive material.<\/p>\n<p>A separate report discovered a line of T-shirts from seller Harma Art featuring\u00a0pictures of the murder of a Jewish man in Ukraine, which were later removed by Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>Of the accounts still selling antisemitic images, many have spam-like names or product descriptions. One online as of Monday morning even had the garbled name \u201cFdgdfhsad\u201d \u2013\u00a0yet it was still able to bypass Amazon&#8217;s systems.<\/p>\n<p>Industry experts have warned that Amazon&#8217;s online marketplace is increasingly flooded with counterfeits and algorithm-generated products.<\/p>\n<p>Tosshan Ramgolam, an advisor at intellectual property software firm Incopro, said there was a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d of direct sellers competing for space on Amazon while the infamous \u201cholocaust Christmas memorabilia\u201d\u00a0appeared to be \u201ccaused by a seller automatically pulling images and placing them on its product for print\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf platforms took self-regulation of their service seriously, these unfortunate circumstances would rarely crop up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Previous controversies have gripped Amazon&#8217;s algorithmic marketplace. A T-shirt on a sales page seemingly targeted at children was removed last month for featuring the phrase \u201cDaddy&#8217;s Little Slut\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, The Telegraph\u00a0discovered products celebrating Nazism and the Holocaust, such as T-shirts from a Russian\u00a0\u00a0&#8220;alt-right&#8221;\u00a0website.<\/p>\n<p>In July last year, Amazon said it would remove listings featuring NeoNazi symbols from its website.<\/p>\n<p>As well as incidents of hateful products appearing on Amazon, fake or counterfeit goods have still flooded the ecommerce site. A Which? investigation published just last week found dozens of fake electrical goods for sale on Amazon. The consumer watchdog said Amazon and other sites were failing at\u00a0\u00a0\u201cbasic steps\u201d to stop harmful goods.<\/p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal reported last month that there has been a surge in Chinese sellers marketing products directly to consumers over Amazon. \u201cThese sellers&#8230; represent a high portion of problem listings found on the site,\u201d the Journal reported.<\/p>\n<p>The company selling images of \u201cThe Eternal Jew\u201d on T-shirts and cushions, is based in Chaohu, China, according to its merchant&#8217;s page, and offers over 2,000 variations on the same \u201cnovelty T-shirt\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon declined to immediately answer questions from The Telegraph on why the account had remained online or\u00a0how such products were able to appear on the site.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article in The Telegraph <a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/2019\/12\/02\/auschwitz-themed-christmas-ornaments-ended-amazon\/\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2349,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How Auschwitz-themed Christmas ornaments ended up on Amazon | The Telegraph - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/how-auschwitz-themed-christmas-ornaments-ended-up-on-amazon-the-telegraph\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"How Auschwitz-themed Christmas ornaments ended up on Amazon | The Telegraph\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"It takes about 10\u00a0seconds to find an antisemitic\u00a0product for sale on\u00a0Amazon.
