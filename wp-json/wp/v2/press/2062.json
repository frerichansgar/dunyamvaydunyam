Sam Brooks and Gajan Rajanathan from Highland Europe are joining the Incopro board.<\/p>\n<p>The company will use the investment to accelerate the development of its Talisman online brand protection technology to help businesses safeguard their brands from counterfeit and piracy threats online. Incopro will also expand its existing operations in China, as well as strengthen its presence in the United States and Europe to provide truly global threat coverage to clients.<\/p>\n<p>A business idea hatched over coffee in 2011, Incopro \u2013 which is today at the forefront of the $1bn-plus online brand protection market \u2013 combines the legal and technical expertise of its co-founders Simon Baggs (CEO) and\u00a0<strong>Bret Boivin<\/strong>\u00a0(CTO), with the law enforcement and intelligence background of\u00a0<strong>Helen Saunders<\/strong>\u00a0(COO) to deliver innovative solutions to companies facing the threat of IP infringement on a global scale.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnline IP infringement is a global issue that affects companies in all sectors, from luxury goods to automotive spare parts,\u201d says Incopro\u2019s co-founder and CEO\u00a0<strong>Simon Baggs<\/strong>. \u201cThe internet revolution has created a massive challenge for businesses seeking to protect their products and brands from counterfeiting and other forms of brand abuse online. Until now, brands have not been offered the tools to effectively deal with this threat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTalisman uses cutting-edge technology to identify and enforce not just individual infringements, but whole networks of illicit behaviour. This unique, intelligence-driven enforcement strategy has a lasting impact on counterfeiters, benefitting clients\u2019 bottom lines. It is crucial that an online brand protection strategy truly addresses the root of the problem, rather than just playing a game of \u2018whack-a-mole\u2019 \u2013 and that is how we have built Talisman.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>\u2018<strong>Machine learning tech<\/strong>\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Talisman monitors IP infringements by scouring all corners of the web in real time using machine learning technology, pulling in data from major platforms ranging from online marketplaces and social media through to websites and app stores. Intelligent algorithms prioritise the key issues for clients and its unique, automated network analysis identifies sophisticated, large-scale operators.<\/p>\n<p>The removal of each identified infringement typically occurs within eight to 24 hours, with a 99 percent success rate. Incopro&#8217;s customers include a host of household name brands including\u00a0<strong>Reckitt Benckiser<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>Ted Baker<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>ghd<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>NBC Universal<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>Harley-Davidson<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>Hunter<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>Tangle Teezer<\/strong>, and\u00a0<strong>BBC Studios<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s other products include Identify, a market-leading anti-piracy intelligence tool that tracks over 17,000 piracy websites across the globe, and Spectrum, which helps brands navigate an increasingly opaque ad-buying universe to ensure their adverts are not positioned beside undesirable content.<\/p>\n<h3>Incopro \u2013 which has been recognised in major industry awards including the Managing Intellectual Property, UK Innovation in IP Award (2018) and the Financial Times Innovation in IP award (2015) \u2013 will focus the investment in three key areas.<\/h3>\n<p>First, it will accelerate the development of Talisman, building on its AI-driven capabilities to rapidly identify and eliminate IP infringements, as well as expand its product suite to offer clients a full range of tools to ensure the success of their digital strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Second, the business will scale its global footprint \u2013 building on its existing presence in North America, Europe and China. Incopro will continue investing in and growing its current team in Shanghai, critical to the overall global strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Incopro will continue to build out its outstanding leadership team. Following the recent addition of\u00a0<strong>Johannes Hertz<\/strong>\u00a0as CFO, it announces today the appointment of\u00a0<strong>Chris Hardy<\/strong>\u00a0as Chief Revenue Officer for the company, joining from OVH (the cloud storage provider).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs experienced e-commerce and marketplace investors, we are intimately familiar with both the opportunity and the challenge that brands face from the global secular shift of retail and media consumption,\u201d says Sam Brooks, Partner of Highland Europe. \u201cWe believe that the scale of the challenge for brand and IP owners is enormous and growing in complexity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have been impressed by the deep domain expertise that Simon, Bret, Helen and the Incopro team have leveraged to build such a compelling platform, protecting the interests of some of the best-known brands globally.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Simon Baggs adds: \u201cWe\u2019re very excited to be partnering with the Highland Europe\u00a0team and their collective experience building global category winners. We look forward to our shared journey ahead.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Houlihan Loukey acted as financial advisor to Incopro on this transaction.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2063,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[140],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Incopro raises $21m from Highland Europe to scale its online brand &amp;
