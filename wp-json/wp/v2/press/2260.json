Support from the Welsh Government and the quality of multilingual graduates with technical and analytic skills within a rapidly growing tech company have played a key role in this continued investment within Wales.<\/p>\n<p>Incopro chose to restore a vacant historic building rather than traditional office space. The restoration of the building, which started life as the original Cardiff fish market and was most recently a restaurant, was led by Downs Merrifield Architects supported by a project team of RPA and Imium. Grade 2 listed large Victorian decorative arches have been preserved and the open plan office is lit by a large glass atrium.<\/p>\n<p>Incopro use big data and machine learning\/AI technology to protect many of the world\u2019s leading brands online. The company combines expertise in intellectual property and intelligence gathering techniques to automate the detection investigation and enforcement against IP infringement online. With offices also in London, Los Angeles, Idaho and Shanghai along with operations throughout North America and Europe it is a rapidly growing company and exciting to see Wales as a key component within this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Economy Minister Ken Skates said:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIncopro provides a vital service to leading brands across the world, protecting them from increasingly sophisticated criminal enterprises using cutting edge technological innovation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am delighted we have been able to provide support for their ambitious growth plans, which will see this exciting company create jobs for more highly skilled professionals here in Wales.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Simon Baggs, CEO at Incopro commented:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe language, data analysis and software engineering skills of the people we have been able to hire in Cardiff has exceeded our expectations. Cardiff is our focus for expansion in the next 12 months as we extend our global service. We are proud to have given new life to a previously abandoned historic building with real character for our new offices, right in the city centre, giving our people a fantastic working environment in which they will thrive.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Welsh Government\u2019s support was instrumental in our initial choice of Wales. The global business climate is challenging but our talented team in Cardiff contributes massively to the great service we offer our global brand customers and our continued expansion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article on\u00a0Business News Wales <a href=\"https:\/\/businessnewswales.com\/tech-firm-relocates-to-the-heart-of-cardiff-with-plans-for-expansion\/\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2146,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Tech Firm Relocates to the Heart of Cardiff with Plans for Expansion | Business News Wales - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/tech-firm-relocates-to-the-heart-of-cardiff-with-plans-for-expansion\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Tech Firm Relocates to the Heart of Cardiff with Plans for Expansion | Business News Wales\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Incopro, the global online brand protection software company, today announced the opening of their new office in the heart of Cardiff.
