Of those listings 24% of all items were suspected as fake and therefore being sold illegally. eBay sellers alone accounted for over half of all suspect items of \u201cgold\u201d jewellery being sold online, where there was no mention of a hallmark, between 21 March and 1 April 2019.<\/p>\n<p>It is illegal to sell anything in the UK made from a precious metal (silver, gold, platinum and palladium) over a certain weight without a hallmark \u2013 a stamp of quality that protects the consumer by confirming that what they are buying is made from real precious metal. The research suggests around 150,000 items of fake \u201cgold\u201d jewellery could be listed for sale in the UK each year, through online marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>Noel Hunter, Chairman of the British Hallmarking Council said, \u201cThe UK Hallmarking Act (1973) was put in place to protect consumers and retail jewellers from counterfeits, but the application of the legislation to online trading activity remains untested. And we have seen little appetite from the internet giants to step up enforcement or adequately protect consumers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur internet sweep highlights just a fraction of the infringements made by online sellers of \u2018precious metal jewellery\u2019 in the UK today. A duty of enforcement currently rests with local Trading Standards departments, who have suffered a 50% cut in their resources over the last five years. Adequate powers are necessary to deal with internet trade.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article on Business Matters <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bmmagazine.co.uk\/news\/third-of-all-gold-jewellery-sold-online-in-uk-could-be-fake\/\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2341,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
