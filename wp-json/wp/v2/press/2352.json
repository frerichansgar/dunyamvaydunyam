Some 27% of 18-24-year olds say they need to do more, with nearly half of those in that category (48%) saying they have lost trust in a brand after purchasing a counterfeit.<br \/> That&#8217;s a big problem for brands. Not only are they suffering from the infringement of their copyright and the loss of revenue that comes with it, but in some way they&#8217;re being blamed by consumers for the fact that criminals are faking their products and consumers are buying them.<br \/> <strong>Piers Barclays, Chief Strategy Officer at Incopro, said:<\/strong> \u201cWith the shopping peak upon us, the risks of counterfeit activity are amplified as online shoppers seek out deals this holiday season. Our research shows that some consumers are regularly being tricked into buying counterfeit goods.<br \/> \u201cHowever, more shockingly, the volume of consumers who are happy to ignore the links between counterfeiting and organised crime, making the conscious decision to purchase fake products, shows the importance of collaboration between brands, platforms and authorities to stop infringers and prevent this societal harm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article in Fashion Network <a href=\"https:\/\/ww.fashionnetwork.com\/news\/Fifth-of-britons-buy-counterfeits-online-says-new-study,1166534.html\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2353,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
