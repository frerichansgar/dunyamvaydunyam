Opportunistic sellers are&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/retail\/demand-for-hand-sanitizer-and-disinfecting-wipes-goes-viral-amid-coronavirus-scare\/\">buying home, health and hygiene-related products&nbsp;<\/a>in bulk&nbsp;and selling them online at a markup. Counterfeiters&nbsp;are taking advantage of the opportunity to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/brand-marketing\/5-quack-covid-19-cures-that-have-been-busted-by-the-feds\/\">sell untested and potentially dangerous products<\/a>, making bogus claims&nbsp;on&nbsp;trusted&nbsp;marketplaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the infringers are agile. They examine and react to market trends. They use proven go-to-market strategies, as legitimate businesses do, leveraging advertising and marketing tactics, such as SEM, SEO, and social media marketing. Facebook, for instance,\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/digital\/facebook-instagram-say-they-directed-1-billion-plus-people-to-covid-19-information\/\">has had to remove millions of ads<\/a>\u00a0promoting the sale of fake masks, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes\u00a0and\u00a0Covid-19 test\u00a0kits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online marketplaces like Amazon\u00a0are also\u00a0known\u00a0to contain counterfeit products. A\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/pulling-together-in-the-age-of-covid-19\/\">recent report<\/a>\u00a0cites a\u00a0272% increase in listings of non-genuine hand sanitizer and anti-bacterial wipes\u00a0on\u00a0e-commerce\u00a0marketplaces in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the equivalent period in 2019.\u00a0Online marketplaces are trusted by consumers, which means that the uptick in counterfeit hygiene products contributes to serious public health risks due to consumers believing they are protecting themselves when the products are likely ineffective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current\u00a0increases in counterfeit goods are not limited to hygiene and health products. With the massive surge in online shopping due to retail closures and lockdowns, there has also been an\u00a0increase in counterfeit activity overall. Even unrelated sectors such as\u00a0household goods, sporting goods, luxury shoes\u00a0are seeing spikes in knockoffs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many consumers turn almost entirely to online shopping, it\u2019s imperative for marketers to support brand health. The Covid-19 pandemic has amplified an already existing problem for brands. Fraudsters can easily access consumer audiences online to peddle fake products that not only eat into the rights owners\u2019 revenues but also erode authentic brands\u2019 reputations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand marketers can help protect consumer safety and defend brand trust. Some strategies to consider are the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Prioritize platforms you are monitoring for counterfeit goods&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Spreading resources across too many online platforms will have a negative impact on protecting consumers from the increased risk of unsafe, non-genuine products. Instead, focus on tracking down knockoffs on platforms where your customers shop most. Prioritize these platforms based on where your brand and authorized sellers operate and where customer confusion is most likely. Push for enforcement on the infringing sellers appearing on the first pages of the online platform\u2019s search results to remove them from visibility of the customer, thereby driving the legitimate results to the top. The goal is to keep these pages clear of infringing products that divert your customer\u2019s attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Temporarily refocus offline resources in the online space\u00a0<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While lockdowns and stay home orders are in place, organizations can leverage some of their offline resources for the online space to protect their consumers and support their online programs. For instance, a freed up employee who is a brand expert can help identify infringing products online and audit online sellers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Track changes in seller behavior<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sellers adapt to changing consumer trends and online platform enforcement measures. Throughout the pandemic,&nbsp;Amazon and other online platforms have been making an effort to prevent sales of items associated with certain description terms, such as \u201ccoronavirus.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, counterfeiters have been getting around these efforts by making false Covid-19 claims in images (as opposed to text) to avoid detection, thereby making these listings more difficult to track down through search and automation techniques. Closely monitor how seller behavior is evolving and how counterfeiters are tricking systems to counteract them in relation to your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Don\u2019t just look for IP infringements\u00a0<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many&nbsp;enforcement mechanisms that can protect consumers from dangerous counterfeit product listings beyond focusing on IP claims.&nbsp;For instance, regulatory compliance is another way to stop unauthorized third parties from selling products outside the regulated guidelines. Many products such as cosmetics, food and medical devices are regulated so a seller is prohibited from selling products that are tampered with or expired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way that brands can tackle infringing behavior that falls outside of straightforward IP infringements is by reporting listings that violate the platform\u2019s terms and conditions. An example of this is an ad that falsely claims a product is compatible with a branded product. This type of ad confuses the consumer into thinking that they are buying a genuine item. Identify the enforcement techniques that work best for your brand and be sure to include them in your monitoring and reporting plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Involve your customers\u00a0<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Research has\u00a0shown\u00a0that some consumers are tricked into purchasing knockoffs while others do so willingly. Consumers can be educated about the harm of buying counterfeit goods, such as how these products often\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/alastair_gray_how_fake_handbags_fund_terrorism_and_organized_crime?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">fund criminal networks and terrorism<\/a>, as a result of intervention by rights holders. Allow your customers to report knockoffs through your website or another channel to empower consumers to help and support your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As consumers spend more time online during the pandemic, it\u2019s vital for brands to proactively monitor key channels and report counterfeiters.\u00a0Brands that are most effective at protecting themselves online work on proactively identifying entire networks of counterfeiters as opposed to reactively enforcing individual listings.\u00a0Not only will this help\u00a0contain leaks from the digital funnel, but most importantly, it will protect the public along with your brand\u2019s reputation, ensuring\u00a0that online consumer experiences reflect brand values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the original article in<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/retail\/5-tips-for-protecting-brands-from-preying-covid-19-counterfeiters\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adweek<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":7741,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
