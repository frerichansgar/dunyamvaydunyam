We want to support our licensees against copycats and infringers and ensure that our consumers can trust every online interaction with Bing. Teaming up with Incopro, with their vast global expertise and leading technology, enables us to give a much stronger guarantee of that.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Piers Barclay, Chief Strategy Officer, Incopro, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be partnering with Acamar Films to protect Bingsters from the risk of poor quality, unsafe counterfeits and the sadly growing number of threats to consumer trust online.
