The firm will use this technology to provide its clients with a better understanding of the global piracy landscape.<br \/> Dan Glover, partner at McCarthy T\u00e9trault, said: \u201cRights holders are struggling to stem the tide of illegal content appearing online and many traditional enforcement approaches are failing to adequately meet their needs.\u201d<br \/> \u201cA coherent anti-piracy and anti-counterfeiting strategy also involves providing content owners with technological tools and cross-border coverage necessary to protect their intellectual property.\u201d<br \/> Barry Sookman, who is also a partner at McCarthy T\u00e9trault, added: \u201cBy joining the INCOPRO Legal Network, we are able to provide our clients the comprehensive insights they need to battle infringements on a global scale.\u201d<br \/> He said: \u201cThis was a natural fit because of the excellence of firms already in the network as well as INCOPRO\u2019s dedication to innovation and client service. We are proud to be part of this global network and to share the best-in-class insights of these other leaders in combating online piracy.\u201d<br \/> Bird &amp; Bird recently signed up to use INCOPRO\u2019s TALISMAN technology. TALISMAN collects data about brand infringement, aggregates and analyses the data, and then provides tools for targeted enforcement actions.<br \/> The view the original article on IPPro The Internet, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipprotheinternet.com\/ipprotheinternetnews\/article.php?article_id=5560\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here<\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[140],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Incopro forges partnership with Canadian firm - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/incopro-forges-partnership-with-canadian-firm\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Incopro forges partnership with Canadian firm\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Brand protection specialist INCOPRO has partnered with Canadian law firm McCarthy T\u00e9trault.
