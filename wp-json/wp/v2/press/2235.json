Here Simon Baggs, CEO at Incopro, comments on this news.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The announcement comes just weeks after the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.totalbusinessmagazine.com\/2019\/02\/is-amazon-under-threat-from-retail-pirates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">warned investors for the first time in its annual report<\/a> about the risk of fake goods to its profits, platform and reputation.<\/p>\n<p>The problem for Amazon lies in its system for cataloguing listings on the platform (known as the ASIN). Many people don\u2019t realise that any seller of a product can offer goods under the official seller\u2019s listing. So, when a consumer searches for a product on Amazon, he\/she is offered the real product from the official seller and products from other sellers that may or may not be fake. Sometimes these other sellers offer lower priced items. Are they fake or are they genuine?<\/p>\n<p>Previous attempts by Amazon to help brand owners stop fake goods available on its ecommerce marketplace, such as the &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-amazon-com-counterfeit-idUSKBN16S2EU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Registry<\/a>&#8216; programme, have focused on offering faster removal when fakes are spotted by the brand owner. So why is Project Zero any different?<\/p>\n<p>With this initiative, removal is still left to the brand owner, but Amazon is offering tools to help the brand identify fake goods and remove them directly from the platform. It is also offering a scheme to check serialisation codes on packaging if the brand owner introduces these.<\/p>\n<p>The initiative is welcome, but constraints remain:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enrolment is invitation-only to brands currently signed-up to Amazon\u2019s Brand Registry.<\/li>\n<li>Brands that do not own trademarks and instead rely on design rights or patents when enforcing their rights are shut out.<br \/> Broader brand misuse is not tackled \u2013 for example the sale of products that a brand owner does not even itself make but that are promoted using the brand.<\/li>\n<li>The brand owner has no means of prioritising the bigger sellers and the repeat sellers \u2013 if a seller is repeatedly counterfeiting the brand, this needs to be tracked and prioritised.<\/li>\n<li>Without prioritisation, the enforcement process can be time consuming and ineffective in delivering real change.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Automated, AI-based brand protection technology ensures that brands can prioritise the top offenders. By automating the enforcement process, brand owners can save time and achieve impact on the problem. Using Amazon\u2019s tools in combination with smart automation is the best way to make a real difference.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.totalbusinessmagazine.com\/2019\/03\/amazon-project-zero-progress-but-a-long-way-to-go\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">follow this link<\/a> to read the original article from Total Business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2236,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
