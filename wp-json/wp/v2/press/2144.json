Incopro first opened a Welsh office in Caerphilly late in 2017 with only three people but have moved into this new office with a further 50 employees and are recruiting a further 25 before the end of 2019. Support from the Welsh Government and the quality of multilingual graduates with technical and analytic skills within a rapidly growing tech company have played a key role in this continued investment within Wales.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Cardiff-desks_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>(Copyright Imium, 2019)<\/p>\n<p>Incopro chose to restore a vacant historic building rather than traditional office space. The restoration of the building, which started life as the original Cardiff Fish Market and was most recently a restaurant, was led by Downs Merrifield Architects supported by a project team of RPA and Imium.
