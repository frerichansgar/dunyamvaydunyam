The listings on eBay, Amazon and other sites like Preloved were not advertised as hallmarked.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers also found that around a quarter (24 per cent) of listings were suspected as fake \u2013 for examples because they carried a suspiciously low price \u2013 and were being sold illegally.<\/p>\n<p>eBay sellers alone accounted for over half (56 per cent) of all suspect items of \u2018gold\u2019 jewellery being sold online, where there was no mention of a hallmark.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe UK Hallmarking Act (1973) was put in place to protect consumers and retail jewellers from counterfeits, but the application of the legislation to online trading activity remains untested,\u201d comments Noel Hunter, Chairman of the BHC.<\/p>\n<p>He adds: \u201cwe have seen little appetite from the internet giants to step up enforcement or adequately protect consumers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The BHC, Goldsmiths and other assay offices are asking the government to work with them on a \u201crobust enforcement strategy that protects consumers and businesses from internet based, unfair trading practices,\u201d and to encourage online retailers to increase hallmarking information on listings.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article on Securing Industry <a href=\"https:\/\/www.securingindustry.com\/clothing-and-accessories\/study-says-a-third-of-gold-jewellery-sold-online-may-be-fake\/s107\/a10949\/#.XcPl1-j7Q2y\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2337,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Study says a third of gold jewellery sold online may be fake | Securing Industry - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/study-says-a-third-of-gold-jewellery-sold-online-may-be-fake-securing-industry\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Study says a third of gold jewellery sold online may be fake | Securing Industry\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"A UK study of gold jewellery purchased from online listings on sites like Amazon and eBay has found that 36 per cent were suspected counterfeit.
