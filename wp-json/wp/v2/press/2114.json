Selling goods online and through social media is easy and attractive to counterfeiters. The problem is now so prolific that an indiscriminate enforcement approach has very little impact. It\u2019s essential to simplify the identification of infringements and concentrate enforcement efforts. As part of the continued growth of its brand management practice, Bird &amp; Bird has selected INCOPRO\u2019s TALISMAN technology to form a key part of its suite of solutions, enabling clients to track and prioritise infringements on a global scale.<\/p>\n<p>Bird &amp; Bird\u2019s team of expert IP lawyers will offer the TALISMAN platform as an additional service to clients across a range of industries affected by online counterfeiting including luxury, fashion, cosmetics, technology and pharmaceutical.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe IP infringement landscape has fundamentally changed in recent years. Identifying and removing counterfeit goods and copyrighted content is now a challenge dispersed globally on the internet.\u201d said\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.twobirds.com\/en\/our-lawyers\/p\/phil-sherrell1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Phil Sherrell<\/a>, Partner, Bird &amp; Bird. \u201cThe integration of TALISMAN and in particular its strategic approach to connecting clusters of counterfeiters will enable us, and our clients, to take far more decisive and impactful enforcement action.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to be working with Bird &amp; Bird,\u201d added Helen Saunders, Head of Intelligence and Operations, INCOPRO. \u201cBird &amp; Bird understands the complex infringement landscape out there and we\u2019re delighted our technology will now enable its clients to receive a comprehensive answer to the problem. Technology is transforming legal services and it\u2019s great to see a firm like Bird &amp; Bird embrace this change.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2014 ENDS \u2014<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>Media contact(s)<\/strong><br \/> Lori Nilsen<br \/> INCOPRO<br \/> <a href=\"mailto:lori.nilsen@incoproip.com?subject=Bird&amp;Bird%20enquiry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lori.nilsen@incoproip.com<\/a><br \/> +44 (0)20 3051 0494<\/p>\n<p>Emma Lago<br \/> Bird &amp; Bird<br \/> <a href=\"mailto:emma.lago@twobirds.com?subject=INCOPRO%20enquiry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">emma.lago@twobirds.com<\/a><br \/> +44 (0)20 7415 6693<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>About INCOPRO<\/strong><br \/> Founded in 2012, INCOPRO is an online IP protection company.
