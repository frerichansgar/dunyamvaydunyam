A third of the results (three of nine) returned for \u201cComotomo teether\u201d pointed to \u201cpotentially harmful products that misuse the Comotomo trademark,\u201d says the report.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Google takes the view that it is not (and cannot be) a \u2018publisher\u2019 when it is told that it is returning results for counterfeit web pages and so it does nothing,\u201d says Incopro.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf Google did remove these websites from their index these sites would be starved of oxygen and would fail, and there are case studies that prove so. The people who operate infringing websites don\u2019t typically pay for advertising. Instead, they often rely on organic search, knowing that they will be found when consumers use search engines to look for brands or products.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a response to the study reported by Incopro, Google said: \u201cIt\u2019s instructive to note that Web Search results are dynamic, change constantly, and can vary by jurisdiction or individual user.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It goes on: \u201cGoogle aggregates information published on the web returning users different web pages that relate to their search requests but we don\u2019t make any claims about the content of these pages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The company says its usual practice is to evaluate court orders issued against third parties and, \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d, voluntarily remove content from its search results.<\/p>\n<p>The report says changes in case law means search engines could find themselves liable in cases involving counterfeits, and Incopro says Google and other search providers should cooperate with rights holders to build a \u201cscalable process that delivers removal of counterfeit locations from search results at scale.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article in Securing Industry <a href=\"https:\/\/www.securingindustry.com\/pharmaceuticals\/google-refusing-to-links-to-counterfeiting-sites-claims-study\/s40\/a10907\/#.XbF5bkZKhaS\">here<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2310,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Google \u201crefusing to remove links to counterfeiting sites\u201d;
