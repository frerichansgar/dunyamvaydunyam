On Amazon, one major cosmetics brand has been the subject of \u201ca 165% month-to-month increase\u201d in high-risk and possibly\u00a0fake listings in recent weeks. Meanwhile, one luxury fashion brand has experienced \u201can 86% rise\u201d in suspected listings for counterfeits on eBay. \u201cThe increase in infringement experienced on marketplaces is echoed on social media,\u201d explains Incopro brand advisor\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tosshan\/\">Tosshan Ramgolam<\/a>. \u201cPosts promoting counterfeits are often hijacking both generic Black Friday hashtags (eg, #blackfriday and #promoblackfriday) and those set up by brands. For example, we are aware of one luxury brand that has seen a 233% increase in the use of the \u2018#blackfriday\u2019 hashtag on Instagram by users promoting counterfeit watches.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Such a rise has also been witnessed by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alastairsgray\/\">Alastair Gray<\/a>, senior brand protection manager at Tommy Hilfiger. Talking to\u00a0WTR, he explains he has observed a massive increase in fraudulent adverts on Instagram since mid-November. \u201cStarting two weeks ago, there has been a significant spike in the number of scam paid adverts posted by generic new accounts (often created just days in advance) using \u2018Black Friday\u2019 as a keyword that are directing consumers to identical websites with different URLs,\u201d he explains. \u201cThese websites offer huge unrealistic discounts and often have no contact or company information displayed. I have seen these sponsored adverts targeting popular toys, handbags, winter jackets and boots, guitars, and fitness trackers, as well as many popular fashion clothing brands. They rely on the fact that discounts from legitimate businesses may be higher than normal around Black Friday.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Remarkably, Gray says he discovered dozens of fraudulent ads promoted to a single Instagram profile in one day (see examples below). \u201cThis highlights just how fiercely aligned to global shopping events these criminal networks are, orchestrating the creation of hundreds of ad accounts, websites, hosting and payment infrastructures in order to maximize their return on investment whilst competing against the legitimate brands in the same space,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some counterfeit ads for some well-known brands attracting well over 160,000 and 240,000 views, so their reach cannot be underestimated.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/files.lbr.cloud\/320021\/conversions\/instagram_ads_1-full.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A variety of Instagram ads identified in the past few days<\/p>\n<p>Dozens of paid adverts on Instagram promoting suspected counterfeit\u00a0goods \u2013 most of which are still running \u2013 have been found targeting brands including\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/ads\/library\/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=453827978498883\">Furla<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/ads\/library\/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=103230977690511\">Justin Boots<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/ads\/library\/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=107245184056630\">LVMH<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/ads\/library\/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=101721704635037\">Nintendo<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/ads\/library\/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=110334666988852\">Timberland<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/ads\/library\/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=109389477199786\">the NFL<\/a>\u00a0(incidentally, another regularly targeted brand, Stone Island, posted\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B5VLCidiqye\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a warning on Instagram<\/a>\u00a0this week about fake products). A majority of these ads\u00a0use link shorteners (eg, Bit.ly) to misdirect users, with some counterfeiters creating links that are\u00a0only\u00a0accessible when viewed within the Instagram app (and not on the desktop browser). For example, Gray says he recently found one Instagram advert for counterfeit goods that used a domain linked to 3,200 more domains \u2013 800 of which were still active and featured \u2018high discounts\u2019 for branded items and no contact information.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis means that counterfeiters have figured out precisely how to hide their activities from snooping brand owners and possibly even Instagram itself,\u201d Gray explains. \u201cTherefore, unless you can find an ad \u2018in the wild\u2019 (ie, within a profile\u2019s feed), it can be extremely difficult to determine the actual destination website where potentially-deceived consumers end up. So while a counterfeit ad itself may be reported and removed from the platform, the website it once directed to will continue to operate and probably be used again in another advert. On top of that, some scammers use an innocuous website address when configuring an advert (such as a legitimate website from a department store) only to be swap it to a counterfeit website as soon as the advert has been approved and gone live \u2013 this is ninja-level counterfeiting activity!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tips for success<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All of this, unsurprisingly, is a headache for brand owners \u2013 especially at a time when resources may be tighter than usual (due to Thanksgiving and other holiday festivities). To that end, Gray has a number of tips for rights holders to help\u00a0identify and tackle fakes on Instagram:<\/p>\n<li>Sign up \u2013 \u201cWhile you may want to avoid social media in your personal lives, the only way to really be aware of emerging and developing counterfeit and brand abuse trends\u00a0is \u2018to be in it to win it\u2019. You have to be across as much as possible, and that means putting the work in and getting on Instagram.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Join the ad program \u2013 \u201cIt is essential to register for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/contact\/423912757973851\">Facebook\u2019s Commerce and Ads IP Tool<\/a>\u00a0to be able to identify paid advertising using your brand or targeting common keywords (eg, \u201880% off\u2019, \u2018clearance\u2019, \u2018promotion\u2019) as counterfeiters are now avoiding using brands as keywords in adverts altogether. Note, however, that the tool does not currently allow for searches of Instagram account names, post contents, keywords, or hashtags.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Follow relevant accounts \u2013 \u201cOn a practical level, you can try to get \u2018shown\u2019 sponsored adverts for counterfeits or scams; I\u2019ve done this by having active profiles on a mobile device (note that using Instagram on a desktop will not display any sponsored ads, legitimate or otherwise), \u2018following\u2019 popular official brand accounts and using the same phone to visit shopping sites to build up a cookie footprint. All this information on the profile should hopefully trigger targeted advertising, but remember that such targeting is also dependent on where you are located.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Search for your marks \u2013 \u201cConduct regular checks for social media profiles that contain your brand name(s) and follow as many combinations of #brand as possible since counterfeiters often use hashtags to market and generate views of their posts.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Sharing is caring \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough the benefits of talking with other brand owners and to membership organizations and sharing experiences, trends and examples of infringing content. Whether it\u2019s using time-limited and unsearchable functionalities like \u2018Instagram Stories\u2019, counterfeiters are always trying out the next way to target consumers. That means brand owners must work together to understand and counter new threats.\u201d<\/li>\n<p>Of course, this advice is not just for the holiday period \u2013 such illicit activity continues throughout the year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Courses of action<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So while brand owners should ensure they have an effective Instagram enforcement strategy, Gray urges Facebook \u2013 the owner of Instagram \u2013 to consider vetting advertisers. \u201cFor online shopping, and in particular sponsored advertising, transparency and being able to definitively attribute an advertiser from an advertisement is essential for consumer trust and safety,\u201d he says. \u201cThis means being able to have confidence that whoever is selling a particular product or service can be identified, contacted and held to account if things go wrong.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, he suggests that Facebook should \u201celevate\u201d its protocols to ensure that illicit advertisers can be identified. \u201cAt the current time, it appears relatively easy to run a sponsored advert; with just a name and email address to create a community page and a credit card \u2013 this might explain why so many of the advertising accounts are apparently bot-generated,\u201d he notes. \u201cTherefore, Facebook can start with enhanced \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 protocols such as verifying advertisers\u2019 individual\/business name (proven with recognized ID) and street address, phone number, email and any business registration details. Ultimately, when jointly targeted by sustained criminal activity, there should be a determined willingness to work together and hold those ultimately responsible to account, and make it as difficult as possible for counterfeiters to continue to operate and infiltrate genuine buyer experiences.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This message is echoed by the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.aafaglobal.org\/\">American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association<\/a>\u00a0(AAFA), the influential industry trade group which represents hundreds of fashion companies and their suppliers. \u201cCertainly the platforms should be doing more,\u201d contends Christina Mitropoulos, the AAFA\u2019s government relations representative, to\u00a0WTR. \u201cSocial media platforms are becoming more and more of a concern when it comes to the sale of counterfeit products, whether it is in the form of paid advertisements, fake brand profiles, or fake endorsements. Therefore, just verifying the information in the ads they push to users would have a major impact. Beyond that, social media platforms should be working with brands to ensure that the content and ads that they are hosting are for legitimate products.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For its part, Facebook is aware of the issue and recently pointed to its anti-counterfeiting tools and efforts. In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/good-questions-real-answers-how-facebook-helps-brands-protect-against-counterfeits\/\">a post published last week<\/a>, Facebook recognized that the issue of fake goods \u201cis especially top-of-mind for advertisers\u201d in the lead up to the holiday season, and pledged that the company has \u201cstrict policies against counterfeit goods and other kinds of IP violations\u201d. To prove that point, it revealed that in the first half of 2019, it removed 359,000 pieces of content on Instagram in response to 39,200 counterfeit reports submitted by brand owners. Furthermore, it claimed to be investing in machine learning and artificial intelligence \u201cto help block or reduce the distribution of potentially counterfeit content on both Facebook and Instagram\u201d. WTR has reached out to Facebook for additional comments.<\/p>\n<p>While positive strides are being taken by Facebook, some brand owners and industry associations clearly feel that more needs to be done. As Gray concluded in his conversation with\u00a0WTR, he is hopeful that things will improve with more effective cooperation: \u201cPlatforms and brand owners share a responsibility to keep their users and consumers safe and the only way to achieve this is to collaborate in everyone\u2019s best interests.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article on WTR <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldtrademarkreview.com\/anti-counterfeiting\/fake-friday-instagram-urged-verify-advertisers-counterfeit-problem-worsens\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2345,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
