To eradicate the problem for good; brands, lawyers, law enforcement agencies and governments need to work together and target the big players, cutting them off before they can profit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>To view the original article in IPPro the Internet, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipprotheinternet.com\/ipprotheinternetnews\/article.php?article_id=5309#.WJnV_7aLRE5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>click here<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2170,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Infringement could have $4.2 trillion impact in five years | IPPro The Internet - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/infringement-could-have-4-2-trillion-impact-in-five-years\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Infringement could have $4.2 trillion impact in five years | IPPro The Internet\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Counterfeiting and piracy could cost $4.2 trillion globally by 2022, according to a new report.
