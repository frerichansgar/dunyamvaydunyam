As well as tracking over 16,000 sites, the technology provides deep intelligence for a range of enforcement activities, industry co-operations and outreach to Governments. ATurquoise will have access to the Incopro Infringement Index within Identify, which is an expert and logical assessment of the extent of infringements. This scoring system enables robust analytics and a true understanding of the global piracy landscape with a focus on the most egregious operators.<\/p>\n<p>As part of Incopro\u2019s Legal Network, ATurquoise is also able to take advantage of Talisman \u2013 a highly innovative system that can successfully track, prioritise, and enforce against counterfeits, grey market and lookalikes on all digital platforms.<\/p>\n<p>The partnership between ATurquoise and Incopro means both companies can present these technologies to brand owners. This grants ATurquoise access to Incopro\u2019s insights on which\u00a0sites are infringing or facilitating the infringement of intellectual property rights, leading to industry-leading expert advice on appropriate courses of action.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs fashion and luxury legal experts who also specialise in media and entertainment law, we have seen the impact online copyright and counterfeit infringements have on businesses,\u201d explains Anne Marie Pecoraro at ATurquoise. \u201cOn top of this, as members of Incopro\u2019s Legal Network, we have cemented our position as industry-leading legal specialists within the luxury fashion, media, and entertainment sectors. It\u2019s no secret that online counterfeiting is a colossal issue for many luxury brands, and so we are thrilled to be able to announce our partnership with Incopro. The combination of our valuable legal expertise and Incopro\u2019s unique technology means that we can help eliminate online infringement once and for all.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to welcome ATurquoise to the network,\u201d said Simon Baggs, CEO of INCOPRO. \u201cThe firm is widely recognised for its work in the intellectual property, luxury fashion, entertainment and media space, both in France and beyond. Our technology will enable the team to provide its clients with an intelligence-led approach to fighting online copyright and counterfeit infringements and take the necessary steps to quickly see greater, measurable impact from their efforts.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2014 ENDS \u2014<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Incopro<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2012, Incopro is an online brand protection company.

The network operates as a referral mechanism, which not only benefits the law firm partners who are invited to participate in the network, but also assists IP owners by providing a trusted source of legal advice and \/or enforcement services in specific territories outside the UK.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>About ATurquoise<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>ATurquoise is a French boutique law firm founded by Anne-Marie Pecoraro and specialises in intellectual property, luxury and fashion law, entertainment, and media technologies.
