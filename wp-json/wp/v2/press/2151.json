Of those listings, 24% (4,278) were suspected as fake and therefore being sold illegally. eBay sellers alone accounted for over half (56%) of all suspect items of \u201cgold\u201d jewellery being sold online, where there was no mention of a hallmark, between 21 March and 1 April 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Clear links were also found to physical retail premises where some of the items available on-line were being sold in large numbers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Noel Hunter, Chairman of the British Hallmarking Council, says:<\/strong> \u201cThe UK Hallmarking Act (1973) was put in place to protect consumers and retail jewellers from counterfeits, but the application of the legislation to online trading activity remains untested. And we have seen little appetite from the internet giants to step up enforcement or adequately protect consumers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur internet sweep highlights just a fraction of the infringements made by online sellers of \u2018precious metal jewellery\u2019 in the UK today. A duty of enforcement currently rests with local Trading Standards departments, who have suffered a 50% cut in their resources over the last five years. Adequate powers are necessary to deal with internet trade.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gareth Mogg, Director at WRi Group said: \u2018<\/strong>Our joint research with Incopro for this campaign provides a snapshot of the scale of the problem facing legitimate business and consumers from the trade in \u2018fake\u2019 gold jewellery. The use of on-line platforms to distribute these items is an on-going challenge for the law enforcement community and the only way to mitigate the threat is by industry, law enforcement, in this case Trading Standards, and the public to work in partnership to protect both the local and wider UK economy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Piers Barclay, Chief Strategy Officer at Incopro, added: \u2018<\/strong>Many online marketplaces have publicised the programmes they have put in place to protect consumers from fake goods and counterfeits, but these often seem more like paying lip service to the issue than a genuine effort to stop the problem. The evidence collected here clearly demonstrates how prevalent the issue is and how more needs to be done to ensure that laws that apply offline are enforced online as well.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; ENDS &#8211;<\/p>\n<p><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sarah Jurado, Director of Communications, <a href=\"mailto:Sarah.Jurado@thegoldsmiths.co.uk\">Jurado@thegoldsmiths.co.uk<\/a>,<br \/>\n0207 367 9000 \/ 07970 388 967<\/li>\n<li>Gareth Mogg, Director, WRi Group, <a href=\"mailto:gareth@wri-group.com\">gareth@wri-group.com<\/a> 02921 202597<\/li>\n<li>Jon Brown, PR Account Manager for Incopro, <a href=\"mailto:incopro@itpr.co.uk\">incopro@itpr.co.uk<\/a> 0207 183 8200<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE RESEARCH<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The online insight report was conducted by WRi Group in partnership with Incopro \u2013 both brand protection agencies \u2013 on behalf of the British Hallmarking Council and the Goldsmiths\u2019 Company Assay Office. Insights were drawn from online monitoring of UK marketplaces (Amazon, Depop, eBay, Freeadsd, Fruugo, Gumtree, PostAdsUK and Preloved) and social media (Facebook and Instagram) for 10 days from 21\/03\/2019 to 01\/04\/2019. The research ONLY looked at items sold as \u201cgold\u201d. It did not include other precious metal items.<\/p>\n<p>The research looked at:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>how many items are sold as \u201cgold\u201d without a hallmark being referenced in the title or the text of a listing or post. This excluded gold \u2013plated, rolled, golden, coated, bonded, vintage; items pre-1950. And focused on products; bracelet, chain, necklace, ring.<\/li>\n<li>How many \u201cgold\u201d items are sold as bearing a UK hallmark, but where a price would indicate that this is too low.<\/li>\n<li>How many items are sold as bearing a hallmark accepted in the UK.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The research found:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>11,280 listings for products where a hallmark had been detected<\/li>\n<li>6,377 listings for products where a hallmark had not been detected<\/li>\n<li>135 listings for products being sold with a non-UK Hallmark detected<\/li>\n<li>4,278 suspected infringing items for sale<\/li>\n<li>2,893 suspected infringing listings on the top UK platforms for less than 50% RRP<\/li>\n<li>**\u00a31,143,383 potential infringer revenue from suspicious listings.

In the UK, all jewellery that is sold as having been made with gold, silver, platinum or palladium, must be hallmarked according to the Hallmarking Act 1973. *The hallmarking law exempts precious metal objects that weigh under a certain number of grams. This could mean small jewellery items like stud earrings or pendants. Jewellery does not have to be hallmarked if it weighs under:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1 gram for gold<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>5 gram for platinum &amp; palladium <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>78 grams for silver<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Only jewellery that carries an officially registered British or international hallmark can be sold in the UK. A hallmark will usually include the Assay Office town mark, together with 2-4 additional marks, such as a date letter, a metal standard symbol or a duty stamp. There are hundreds of registered hallmark elements.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HALLMARKING KEYS<\/strong><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/cms\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Hallmarking-keys_-1024x414.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>ASSAY OFFICE TOWN\u00a0MARKS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Assay-Office-Town-Marks_.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE BRITISH HALLMARKING COUNCIL <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0BHC\u00a0supervises the hallmarking activities of assay offices to ensure there is adequate provision of hallmarking in the UK.
