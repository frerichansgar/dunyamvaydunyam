Similarly, Google earlier this month added a form people can submit to request a search result be taken down because it contains counterfeit products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t a new issue by any means. Counterfeit goods are a nearly $900 billion industry,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.glossy.co\/fashion\/its-not-doing-enough-amazons-counterfeits-business-is-a-deal-breaker-for-luxury-brands#\">according<\/a>&nbsp;to the authentication company Entrupy. And platforms like Amazon and Google have long been lambasted for taking lackluster measures to defend against fake products. LVMH, for example, once said it wouldn\u2019t sell its products on Amazon because counterfeits were also available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Google has been called out for not providing adequate assistance for brands seeing counterfeits popping up in organic search results. Last October, Superdry&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.modernretail.co\/platforms\/how-googles-counterfeit-search-problem-could-hurt-its-commerce-ambitions\/\">told Modern Retail<\/a>&nbsp;it had taken down more than $207 million worth of counterfeit products it found on various digital channels. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a significant problem,\u201d the apparel brand\u2019s head of legal, James Sweeting, said at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it seems both are trying to take steps to further crack down on the problem. According to a Google spokesperson, the company has been piloting new processes to help fight counterfeits with select brands, soliciting feedback about best practices. The company also plans on using the data from the notices to develop new ranking solutions. This means that if a site is consistently reported to be offering counterfeit goods, Google will use that data to have it perform worse in search over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a development we cautiously welcome,\u201d said Michael Sweeney, senior legal counsel at the brand protection company Incopro. Before the addition of the webform, brands had to submit court orders to get Google to take down listings of counterfeit goods. His team has been lobbying Google for years to up its protections against counterfeit goods; a white paper it published last year claimed that 60% of the results it found on Google search were counterfeits (Google questioned Incopro\u2019s methodology at the time).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe devil is in the details,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cThere is so much more that Google can and should do,\u201d he added. For one, the burden of proof is still on brands and retailers to find and report each occurrence of a counterfeit listing. \u201cThat leaves brands in a very unsatisfactory position,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon has made various attempts to crack down on counterfeits, with programs like its brand registry as well as machine learning solutions to help detect bad actors. This move is slightly more significant because it adds an external element \u2014 namely, law enforcement agencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a positive development,\u201d said Mark Power, founder and CEO of the consultancy Podean. \u201cIt\u2019s not really going to stop the problem in its tracks,\u201d he added, but the addition thread of the legal system may give some counterfeiters pause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing, in his estimation, is crucial. \u201cIt\u2019s three months after the pandemic and a lot of brands are reconsidering their strategies,\u201d Power said. That is, companies that before didn\u2019t rely on online sales channels due to brick and mortar being such a consistent engine are now rethinking things. With that, some premium brands who may have been resistant to marketplaces like Amazon are likely looking for new sales channels as well as assurances that their products are protected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s still very much early days. While both companies are making similar moves, brands will be more interested to observe execution. \u201cThe proof will be in the pudding,\u201d said Power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Read the original article in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.modernretail.co\/platforms\/amazon-and-google-are-increasingly-cracking-down-on-counterfeits\/\">ModernRetail<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":8668,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Amazon and Google are increasingly cracking down on counterfeits | ModernRetail - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/amazon-and-google-are-increasingly-cracking-down-on-counterfeits-modernretail\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Amazon and Google are increasingly cracking down on counterfeits | ModernRetail\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"As more brands move to selling goods online, platforms are beginning to crack down on counterfeits.
