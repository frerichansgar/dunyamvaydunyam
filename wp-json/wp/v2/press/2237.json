It can foster cross-pollination. \u201cPeople recognise that sharing is vital for innovation. It should be encouraged as long as it doesn\u2019t prejudice the IP rights in question,\u201d argues Dr Sean Jauss, partner at Mewburn Ellis in Bristol.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is, when it comes to sharing IP, different jurisdictions can require that an IP application is filed in the country where the original inventor resides. If several countries demand this then it make open sourcing an expensive process that ends up being weighed down by red tape.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt forces companies to file IP applications in countries where they have no commercial interest,\u201d says Peter Arrowsmith of Gill Jennings and Every. \u201cInternational harmonisation in this area is badly needed so inventors can freely collaborate across borders.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This won\u2019t be easy though. Mr Baggs says IP collaboration may be important for innovation, but in some instances the use of IP by another company can damage the original creator\u2019s reputation, such as when copycat companies in China produce cheaper and poorly manufactured imitations.<\/p>\n<p>Things are further complicated because territories have varying rules on when consent from co-owners of IP needs to be obtained for another co-owner to grant non-exclusive and exclusive licences. In the United States, for example, each co-owner can exploit a patent and grant an exclusive licence without the consent of co-owners, blocking them from personally using the patent.<\/p>\n<p>To encourage innovation, Mr Arrowsmith believes there needs to be a liberal attitude to the movement of ideas and sharing IP. What this would look like on a global scale is open to debate.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>To read the full article from Raconteur, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raconteur.net\/risk-management\/sharing-ip-caution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">follow this link<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2238,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
