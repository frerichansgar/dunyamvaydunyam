From its larger offices in the center of Cardiff, where it has a workforce of 50, it will recruit a further 25 by year end.<\/p>\n<p>Incopro uses big data and machine learning\/AI technology to protect many of the world\u2019s leading brands online.<br \/> It combines expertise in intellectual property and intelligence gathering techniques to automate the detection investigation and enforcement against IP infringement online.<\/p>\n<p>It chose to restore a vacant historic building on the Hayes rather than traditional office space. The restoration of the building, which started life as the original Cardiff fish market and was most recently a restaurant, was led by Downs Merrifield Architects supported by a project team of RPA and Imium. The grade 2 listed large Victorian decorative arches have been preserved and the open plan office is lit by a large glass atrium.<\/p>\n<p>Economy Minister <strong>Ken Skates<\/strong> said: \u201cIncopro provides a vital service to leading brands across the world, protecting them from increasingly sophisticated criminal enterprises using cutting edge technological innovation. I am delighted we have been able to provide support for their ambitious growth plans, which will see this exciting company create jobs for more highly skilled<br \/> professionals here in Wales.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It also has offices in London, Los Angeles, Idaho and Shanghai along with operations throughout North America and Europe. Its chief executive<br \/> <strong>Simon Baggs<\/strong> said:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The language, data analysis and software engineering skills of the people we have been able to hire in Cardiff has exceeded our expectations. Cardiff is our focus for expansion in the next 12 months as we extend our global service&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are proud to have given new life to a previously abandoned historic building with real character for our new offices, right in the city center, giving our people a fantastic working environment in which they will thrive.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Welsh Government\u2019s support was instrumental in our initial choice of Wales.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe global business climate is challenging but our talented team in Cardiff contributes massively to the great service we offer our global brand customers and our continued expansion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Property advisory firm Cooke and Arkwright acquired the property on behalf of Incopro, which has taken a lease.\u00a0<strong>Mark Siddons<\/strong>, senior surveyor in its business space team, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see new life being breathed into the first floor of this iconic building following the conversion from A3 leisure to office use. The Hayes is a well known landmark within Cardiff and this property has lots of character and history. We are sure Incopro will benefit from occupying such a high profile city center location&#8221;.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article on Western Mail\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/links2017.precise.co.uk\/batchpdfs\/9d001916-4eab-4290-a073-dd9da4ef688b.pdf\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2145,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Software firm looks to expand after new office move | Western Mail - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/software-firm-looks-to-expand-after-new-office-move\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Software firm looks to expand after new office move | Western Mail\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Global\u00a0online brand protection software company Incopro has opened a new office in Cardif where it is recruiting for more high-skilled staff.
