Plus, 25% of consumers don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s important for online influencers and celebrities to provide an authentic representation of themselves.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Dive Insight:<\/h3>\n<p>The sale of fake items\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/counterfeits-the-nightmare-before-christmas\/544396\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has been a problem for retailers<\/a>\u00a0for some time, especially during the holiday season. Online marketplaces like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/amazon-ebay-join-effort-to-combat-counterfeits\/526527\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/ebay-launching-authentication-service-to-fight-fakes\/434031\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eBay<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/etsy-has-a-counterfeit-problem-report\/396719\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etsy<\/a>\u00a0have often been the subject of scrutiny for counterfeit goods sold on their sites. Amazon has been\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/amazon-unveils-project-zero-to-fight-counterfeits\/549501\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">combating counterfeit goods<\/a>, through its transparency service, which uses unit codes to verify authentication, and &#8220;Project Zero&#8221; which uses advanced tech with the brands&#8217; product knowledge to combat fakes,\u00a0in addition to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/amazon-fights-back-against-aafas-notorious-market-claims\/564286\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fending off claims of facilitating fake merchandise sales<\/a>. If nothing else, the Incopro report indicates that online marketplaces may have to work harder to remove fake items from their platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon, in particular, has been the target of brands seeking to curb sales of knock-offs. Last December, Williams-Sonoma sued the online retail giant for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/williams-sonoma-sues-amazon-over-alleged-west-elm-copies\/544861\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">allegedly selling knockoffs of its West Elm brand<\/a>.

(Last December,\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/17m-worth-of-counterfeit-nike-sneakers-seized\/543813\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seized $1.7 million of fake Nike<\/a>\u00a0shoes.)<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, brands and resale merchants alike have attempted to address fake goods in court and online. In February, David Yurman\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/david-yurman-awarded-16m-in-counterfeit-case\/547506\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">won about $1.6 million<\/a>\u00a0in a lawsuit against websites selling counterfeit merchandise.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/ralph-lauren-launches-digital-ids-to-authenticate-merchandise\/566629\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ralph Lauren<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/armed-with-tech-goodwill-joins-fight-against-designer-fakes\/545681\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Goodwill<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/lvmh-creates-blockchain-platform-to-track-luxury-goods\/555050\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LVMH<\/a>, have introduced digital tools to track products throughout their lifecycles and stop the sale of knockoffs.<\/p>\n<p>But why do some shoppers, per Incopro&#8217;s report, think that buying fake luxury items is OK? The answer\u00a0could be price, according to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/report-high-prices-push-gen-z-to-purchase-counterfeits\/555261\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a report from the International Trademark Association<\/a>.
