At least one in every three websites found in web searches were selling counterfeit products or products that infringed intellectual property.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe advice of the industry is that customers should only trust vehicle parts acquired through the authorized dealer network,\u201d said Tony Weber, Chief Executive of the FCAI.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThrough our Genuine is Best initiative we have seen counterfeit brake pads, wheels, steering parts, oil filters, air filters, spark plugs and bonnets. They fail, they shatter, they catch fire or they snap in half,\u201d Weber was quoted as saying in the press release.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey put road users in harm\u2019s way. We aren\u2019t talking about clothing or handbags here. Counterfeit automotive parts directly endanger lives.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are trusting of search engine results. They click what is returned on the first page. That trust comes with an obligation for search engine operators. If any business is made aware the products on display may be dangerous, they should remove them. Failing to do this could cost lives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The FCAI has vigorously defended against the incursion of counterfeit parts in the retail automotive parts market, even asking online trading portals to remove listings and retailers of counterfeit parts.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, the FCAI learned of spark plugs that risked catastrophic damage to engine internals. The chamber keeps track of counterfeit parts like this in a database that includes oil filters that don\u2019t filter oil, wheels that shatter in low-speed pothole impacts (pictured), asbestos used in friction material for brake pads and linings. But the case that topped the lot for the FCAI was the set of brake pads made from compressed grass clippings.<\/p>\n<p>The Chamber invites consumers, motorists and mechanics\u00a0to report counterfeit parts via the website. Each report is forwarded to the car company concerned, as well as the Department of Home Affairs. Incopro also keeps tabs on counterfeit parts\u00a0through its own website, and\u00a0the ACCC is in the loop too.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article on Motoring <a href=\"https:\/\/www.motoring.com.au\/most-web-searches-lead-to-counterfeit-parts-121239\/\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2300,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
