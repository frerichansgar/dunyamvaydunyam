If you don\u2019t believe me, try typing \u2018Will AI\u2019 into Google and see the list of recommended search results littered with negative connotations.<\/p>\n<p>Will AI replace programmers? Will AI take my job? Will AI destroy humanity?<\/p>\n<p>While the answer to all of these questions is hopefully not, a lot of the criticism and focus on AI has so far revolved around if it will one day replace humans rather than how it is taking away a lot of the mundane and soul-crushing tasks that slow us down and make us grumpy.<\/p>\n<p>One area where a bit of AI goes a long way is counterfeits \u2013 more specifically, to help keep them off the Internet, thus preventing innocent buyers from getting ripped off.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Ecommerce a breeding ground for counterfeits<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The \u2018supply and demand\u2019 eCommerce model combined with the global availability of the Internet has made the sale of counterfeits easier and more profitable than ever.<\/p>\n<p>Legitimate webpages, items and product details are easily replicable, and the sheer scale of the eCommerce market on the Internet along with endless domain names being set up every day makes it almost impossible for a person to manually check every single product and website.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, the number of counterfeits appearing online has grown to an amount where manual searches have become increasingly futile.<\/p>\n<p>And, as manufacturing methods improve and fakes become more convincing, they\u2019ll eventually reach a stage where experts and the brands that made the original product will struggle to tell the difference between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Does Amazon have a counterfeit problem?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>For the first time in its annual report,\u00a0Amazon warned investors this year\u00a0about the risk of counterfeits on its online platform.<\/p>\n<p>Under the \u2018risk factors\u2019 section of the report, Amazon said: \u201cWe also may be unable to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, Amazon\u2019s recent work against counterfeits, including its\u00a0Brand Registry program, has proven to be highly ineffective, and the majority of what they\u2019re claiming seems to be purely lip service.<\/p>\n<p>Many brands are also still hesitant to let the marketplaces police themselves, and many smaller manufacturers can\u2019t provide the staffing required to monitor the site for fakes on Amazon\u2019s behalf \u2013 highlighting another possible use case for AI.<\/p>\n<p>This should be a wake-up call to everyone. If one of the most powerful companies in the world has admitted that they have a problem, and are pessimistic about their current approach, perhaps it\u2019s time to re-think the problem. Is this a place where AI can be used?<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Can AI help catch counterfeits?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>On the face of it, AI certainly looks promising.<\/p>\n<p>Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, along with 20 other international brands, created the \u2018Big Data Anti-Counterfeiting Alliance\u2019 in 2017 \u2013 an initiative that uses AI to detect tell-tale flaws in product listings and customer reviews.<\/p>\n<p>According to The Drum, early results using the technology showed a 25 percent decline in take-down requests and has closed down 230,000 IP-infringing stores on its sister website, Taobao.<\/p>\n<p>And, despite admitting to a counterfeit problem, Amazon this year\u00a0announced its Project Zero initiative\u00a0to help combat the issue. The program will use a combination of machine learning, a self-service tool, and product serialization codes to help brand owners fight back.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Countering the counterfeiters<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>While the war over counterfeits may never be over, it\u2019s possible for enterprises and brands to gain the upper hand. By utilizing intelligent anti-counterfeit systems, it is possible to thwart fakes at scale.<\/p>\n<p>But it won\u2019t work without the co-operation and participation of brand owners as well as the marketplaces that host them.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s vital for any company with products, content, brands or other assets that can be counterfeited to explore the options for how to best use AI to counter the counterfeiters.<\/p>\n<p>AI technology can be specifically tailored to autonomously detect masses of low-cost, high-volume counterfeit goods. By analyzing materials, colors, packaging and other key attributes to spot fakes, AI helps keep fakes off the web, thus protecting consumers and businesses from the scammers that want to rip them off.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article on AI Business\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aibusiness.com\/can-artificial-intelligence-keep-counterfeit-goods-off-the-web\/\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2262,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Can artificial intelligence keep counterfeit goods off the web?
