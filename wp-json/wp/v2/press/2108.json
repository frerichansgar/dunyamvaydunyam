Equustek Solutions Inc, whereby the Canadian Supreme Court ruled the search engine giant must de-index certain counterfeit websites entirely from its search platforms globally. The firm acted for domestic and international content industry intervenors before the British Columbia Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada, and their representations were specifically relied upon by both courts\u2019 decisions. McCarthy T\u00e9trault is also the first Canadian firm to have acted as counsel of record before the Supreme Court of the United States, in the landmark disruptive technologies case\u00a0American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. v Aereo, Inc., where it led an international alliance of rights holders\u2019 organisations and international copyright scholars.<\/p>\n<p>By joining the Incopro Legal Network, McCarthy T\u00e9trault will have access to Incopro\u2019s Identify technology, which was created to provide content owners with a comprehensive overview of global online infringements. The unique technology tracks more than 16,000 websites and provides deep intelligence to aid enforcement activities. Additionally, the Incopro Infringement Index within Identify \u2013 an expert and logical assessment of the extent to which a site is infringing or facilitating the infringement of intellectual property rights \u2013 will assist McCarthy T\u00e9trault in providing its clients a real understanding of the global piracy landscape.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRights-holders are struggling to stem the tide of illegal content appearing online and many traditional enforcement approaches are failing to adequately meet their needs. While the courts are beginning to catch up, as we\u2019ve seen in the recent case against Google, a coherent anti-piracy and anti-counterfeiting strategy also involves providing content owners with technological tools and cross-border coverage necessary to protect their intellectual property,\u201d explains Dan Glover, Intellectual Property Partner at McCarthy T\u00e9trault. \u201cBy joining the Incopro Legal Network, we are able to provide our clients the comprehensive insights they need to battle infringements on a global scale.\u201d Added Barry Sookman, Technology Partner at McCarthy T\u00e9trault, \u201cThis was a natural fit because of the excellence of firms already in the network as well as Incopro\u2019s dedication to innovation and client service. We are proud to be part of this global network and to share the best-in-class insights of these other leaders in combating online piracy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome McCarthy T\u00e9trault to the Legal Network,\u201d said Simon Baggs, CEO of Incopro. \u201cThe firm is widely recognised for its work both nationally and across the globe; additionally, its expertise in IP protection is renowned. Now, McCarthy T\u00e9trault can assist its clients in taking an intelligence-led approach to fighting counterfeit infringements. Inevitably, this will significantly reduce illegal online content and, in turn, enable the law firm to firmly position itself as a leader in online rights protection in Canada and beyond.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2014 ENDS \u2014<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>About McCarthy T\u00e9trault LLP<br \/>\nMcCarthy T\u00e9trault LLP provides a broad range of legal services, advising on large and complex assignments for Canadian and international interests.
