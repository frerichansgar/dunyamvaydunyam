When did we start sharing retailers\u2019 adverts for them, anyway?<\/p>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re one of those sickeningly sorted few who have already done their Christmas shopping,\u00a0the chances are that you will be hitting the high street or the internet in the next few days.<\/p>\n<p>But whenever you need to do a lot of shopping fast there are perils, and not just the risk of forgetting Auntie Audrey\u2019s allergies and sending her sugared almonds.<\/p>\n<p>Shopping online, in particular, can leave you vulnerable to fraudsters and counterfeiters, especially if you are in a hurry or chasing this year\u2019s must-have toy.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the potential pitfalls this Christmas \u2013 and how to avoid them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fraudulent websites<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s become easier for criminals to publicise their fraudulent websites thanks to social media. Well-meaning users share what looks like a great deal and that encourages their friends to trust the website in question and make purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we are all more susceptible to fraud if we are chasing a bargain. Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason it\u2019s known as Black Fraud Day in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the five years since Black Friday was established as a fixture in the UK shopping calendar, it has become the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping frenzy. The sheer number of people going online for bargains, and the fact we\u2019re under pressure to buy in a hurry, means we\u2019re particularly vulnerable to fraudsters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Research\u00a0by secure payment provider Shieldpay shows that more than three-quarters of shoppers admit using websites they wouldn\u2019t normally shop on during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.<\/p>\n<p>That has an impact \u2013 a quarter of shoppers have fallen victim to fraud on those days as they hunt down what looks like a great deal. They lose an average of \u00a3218, though an unlucky 8 per cent lose over \u00a3500.<\/p>\n<p>Staying safe means taking your time and not being rushed by what seems to be a bargain. Tom Clementson, the director of consumer at Shieldpay, says: \u201cUtilising technology that secures transactions is one way to do this.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlongside that, simple steps like only shopping on trusted websites, checking the website is secure and never clicking on links in unexpected emails go some way to keeping money safe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Counterfeit goods<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Knock-off products such as\u00a0counterfeit clothes and toys don\u2019t just have a negative impact on the companies that make the real thing \u2013 they can also be dangerous to consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Fake goods are unlikely to be made to the same quality as the genuine item and may be poor quality so won\u2019t last long. They will also not have been through the same safety checks as genuine goods, putting people at risk of unsafe electrical goods and even health risks from components of toys and clothing.<\/p>\n<p>Searching online for presents can put consumers at real risk of falling victim to counterfeits.<\/p>\n<p>As much as 60 per cent of the links on some internet search engine results pages are for websites that sell fake and possibly dangerous goods, research by brand protection company Incopro shows.<\/p>\n<p>Fact, an intellectual property protection agency, urges shoppers not to be fooled by large money-off deals because legitimate designer items are rarely heavily discounted.<\/p>\n<p>It advises consumers to look\u00a0to see where the trader is based and if they give an address, and suggests checking the spelling and grammar of the website, including the URL.<\/p>\n<p>Shoppers should also check the website address begins \u201chttps\u201d at the payment stage, as the \u201cs\u201d indicates a secure payment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Overspending<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Christmas can be an expensive time and many people feel real pressure to spend more than they can afford on gifts and entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>That pressure can be particularly intense for parents who want their children to have everything they want \u2013 but that can be a painfully expensive situation.<\/p>\n<p>The debt management company PayPlan surveyed 1,000 people and found that 55 per cent of parents will rely on their credit cards to cover their essential living costs this Christmas, including household bills.<\/p>\n<p>Half of parents say they feel stressed by their finances as Christmas draws near. Whatever your financial situation, setting a budget you can afford and sticking to it is the answer for a Christmas that\u2019s safer for your bank balance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Needless waste<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most of us are making improvements on the amount of single-use and throw-away plastics we buy (some people are going much further) but that can often go out of the window at Christmas.<\/p>\n<p>From tacky presents that no one really needs to stocking fillers and crackers filled with tatty toys, Christmas can cause a mountain of expensive waste.<\/p>\n<p>The organisation BusinessWaste.co.uk estimates that more than 40 million Christmas crackers will end up in the bin on 25 December. It surveyed 1,100 families about their Christmas habits and found that 99 per cent said they simply threw Christmas cracker gifts in the bin at the end of the day.<\/p>\n<p>Deciding not to spend money on unnecessary junk that doesn\u2019t actually enhance the day is better for the planet and definitely better for your wallet.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article in The Independent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/money\/spend-save\/christmas-shopping-safe-money-fraud-adverts-retail-a9213166.html\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2343,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
