Of those fooled into the buy about one-quarter say they never received a refund for the product purchased.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With the shopping peak upon us, the risks of counterfeit activity are amplified as online shoppers seek out deals this holiday season,&#8221; <strong>said Piers Barclay, Chief Strategy Officer of Incopro.<\/strong> &#8220;Our research shows that some consumers are regularly being tricked into buying counterfeit goods while others are making the conscious decision to purchase fake products, which can be unsafe and\/or contribute to funding criminal networks. Consumer education and leadership on this matter is needed from public influencers, including online marketplaces, policy makers, brands, and search engines, to avoid a deeper plunge into the abyss of the black market.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Nearly one-third (32%) of shoppers say that they want digital marketplaces to do more to protect them from these fraudulent purchases. Roughly the same amount believe the government to step in to put a stop to online sellers with fake merchandise.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;While the online environment is becoming increasingly complex, the research suggests&nbsp;that changing consumer preferences are pressuring brands and platforms &#8212; whether ecommerce or social &#8212; to meet evolving expectations by taking greater action to flag genuine goods, limit the propagation of fake items, and take responsibility swiftly and with integrity when issues arise,&#8221; said book author, international speaker, and podcast host, Nathalie Nahai of The Web Psychologist LTD. &#8220;How brands and platforms rise to meet these challenges remains to be seen.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Fully half of those surveyed (52%) say they&#8217;ve lost trust with a retailer because they were sold a fake product.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article in Retail Dive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bizreport.com\/2019\/12\/study-1-in-4-fooled-into-counterfeit-buys.html\">here<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":8503,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Study: 1 in 4 fooled into counterfeit buys | BizReport - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/study-1-in-4-fooled-into-counterfeit-buys-bizreport\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Study: 1 in 4 fooled into counterfeit buys | BizReport\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"While the increase in digital shopping is good for most merchants and brands, there is a downside: counterfeit.
