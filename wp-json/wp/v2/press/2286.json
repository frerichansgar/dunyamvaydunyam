While counterfeiters are continuing to get smarter, they still leave a range of traces that can be used to track down the root of the problem.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Simon Baggs, Chief Executive and Co-founder of Incopro, commented:<\/strong> \u201cUnfortunately, while the ability to purchase prescription products online means consumers have easier access to sourcing important pharmaceuticals, the risks this brings with it are paramount to public safety awareness.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot only has uncontrolled purchasing of pharmaceuticals lead to epidemics like the opioid crisis in America, it also allows for unlawful operators to sell counterfeits products. These counterfeits pose a direct risk to consumers&#8217; safety due to their unregulated production.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost concerningly, potentially infringing pharmaceutical sites are one of the most reliant on search results to drive traffic to their websites. The gravity of the risks that counterfeit medicinal and pharmaceutical products to consumer health and safety is significant. We are calling on search engines to do more in de-indexing and acting on counterfeit sellers that appear in their results and protect consumers from harm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article in Pharmafield <a href=\"https:\/\/pharmafield.co.uk\/pharma_news\/consumers-at-risk-of-buying-fake-pharmaceutical-products\/\">here<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2287,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Consumers at risk of buying fake pharmaceutical products | Pharmafield - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/consumers-at-risk-of-buying-fake-pharmaceutical-products\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Consumers at risk of buying fake pharmaceutical products | Pharmafield\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"60% of online search results for pharmaceutical drug leads to fakes putting consumers at risk of buying fake pharmaceutical products.
