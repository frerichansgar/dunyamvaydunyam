In more than a quarter of cases <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/article\/half-of-uk-consumers-have-bought-counterfeit-goods-online-96d8bkqs6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">counterfeit goods<\/a>\u00a0featured in the top three results.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers conducted millions of searches for children\u2019s products, pharmaceuticals, car parts, white goods, and safety equipment, and uncovered a series of \u201cworrying insights\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>In pharmaceuticals, they found that six in ten of Google\u2019s first-page results following searches for Bactrim, the cystitis drug, were for websites \u201cvery likely\u201d to be operating unlawfully. In the children\u2019s products category a third of results for a\u00a0brand of baby teething toy featured potentially harmful products.<\/p>\n<h3>Simon Baggs, of Incopro, the British technology company that conducted the study, said:<\/h3>\n<h3>\u201cAt best, these products will be poor quality; at worst, they put consumers at risk of harm.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>In a report published today Incopro, which detects fake goods online, says that Google routinely turns down requests to remove links on the basis of trademark infringement.<\/p>\n<p>The report states: \u201cWhen our lawyers asked Google to clarify its position on de-indexing websites where trademarks are infringed, it confirmed that it did not \u2018at this time de-index URLs or websites from its web search index on trademark grounds upon request.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Google dominates searches in Britain with 87.5 percent market share. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says that the counterfeit trade is worth \u00a3454 billion a year globally. An estimated 85 percent of fake products are from China.<\/p>\n<p>The report says that many websites selling fakes are scams trying to elicit shoppers\u2019 card details to steal money.<\/p>\n<p>When\u00a0The Times\u00a0searched \u201cBuy Bactrim online\u201d on Google, eight of the ten websites that appeared in non-paid-for results on the first page linked to suspicious websites. Only one was definitely legitimate and another was inactive.<\/p>\n<p>Six of the ten results redirected to the same website based in the Czech Republic, although in each case the web address that appeared was taken from random other websites, suggesting that these may have been hacked. The Czech website claims it has been operating for more than seven years but its web address has been registered for less than 300 days.\u00a0The Times\u00a0got no reply when it contacted the company.<\/p>\n<p>Mr Baggs said: \u201cOften these websites are scams . . . this makes it all the more extraordinary that Google refuses to remove links to them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Google says that the study\u2019s results have been shaped by the sorts of searches run. It insists that its systems prioritize authoritative pages for customers making broad queries.<\/p>\n<p>It said: \u201cSearch is an index of the web, and the sites in our results are controlled by those sites\u2019 webmasters, not by Google. When people come to search, we aim to help them find relevant and reliable information. We are continuously improving our algorithms to protect people from deceitful sites. We comply with court orders to remove pages from our index, and we will also act on guidance from administrative agencies to remove pages seeking to unlawfully distribute goods that can cause physical harm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article in The Times <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/edition\/news\/google-accused-over-scam-sites-in-search-results-x9qzdlrp7\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2272,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Google accused over scam sites in search results | The Times - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/google-accused-over-scam-sites-in-search-results-the-times\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Google accused over scam sites in search results | The Times\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Google\u00a0has been accused of putting\u00a0internet shoppers\u00a0at risk by refusing to remove links to counterfeit sellers and scam websites.
