And unsurprisingly, 66 per cent of then have lost trust in a brand as a result.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith the value of card spending on the Internet estimated at \u00a3154bn (around $200bn) per year and the OECD estimating that (\u00a376bn) of imported goods are counterfeit or pirated, the financial cost to both consumers and brands of this counterfeit explosion cannot be underestimated,\u201d says the report.<\/p>\n<p>The findings, conducted by independent pollster Sapio Research, also showed that one in five (22 per cent) of consumers surveyed said they have lost between \u00a3100 and \u00a3500 in the past 12 months from buying products that turned out to be fake.<\/p>\n<p>It also seems it\u2019s the youngest that are hit hardest when it comes to purchasing counterfeit goods, says Incopro. It turns out 18 to 24-year olds are most likely to get ripped off online, with 25 per cent having lost between \u00a3100 &#8211; \u00a3249 from counterfeit goods in the past 12 months alone.<\/p>\n<p>The findings also make it clear that a sizeable proportion of UK consumers \u2013 a quarter of those surveyed &#8211; knowingly purchased counterfeit goods in the past year, \u201creinforcing the point that counterfeits are now so endemic that consumers are becoming inured to the concept.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Health and safety risk<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Worryingly, 9 per cent of consumers report they have been injured or suffered a health issue as a result of purchasing counterfeit goods online.<br \/> \u201cFrom fake trainers that result in injury, airbags that failed to explode on impact, dangerous substitute medicines, counterfeit vodka which may include ant-freeze or cleaning \ufb02uid and lead to black outs, blurred vision, short-term sight loss and even death in extreme cases, all the way to cycle helmets that shatter at the slightest impact \u2013 many of the counterfeit products routinely purchased by UK consumers can be extremely hazardous,\u201d says Incopro.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/report\/counterfeit-products-are-destroying-brand-value\">Download the Report<\/a><\/p>\n<p>To read the original article from Securing Industry, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.securingindustry.com\/a-quarter-of-uk-consumers-bought-fake-goods-in-the-last-year\/s112\/a8656\/#.W8nsWmhKiUm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2205,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
