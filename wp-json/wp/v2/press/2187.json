While it\u2019s by no means a new phenomenon, today the practice can be more valuable than ever thanks to a seemingly insatiable appetite for insights into the lives of our idols. While there are a number of issues surrounding the practice \u2013 from making it clear individuals have been paid to tweet about a dress or carry a handbag, to what happens when controversy strikes the advocate \u2013 considered less frequently is the influence celebrity endorsements have on counterfeiting.<\/p>\n<p>One of the cornerstones for the success of a luxury brand is the desirability of its designs. When a well-known and coveted celebrity is seen with a designer\u2019s products, their desirability increases. The item becomes aspirational and ownership gives the impression of a certain lifestyle. But not everyone can afford that lifestyle. It\u2019s a psychology counterfeiters know all to well and know how to take advantage of. It\u2019s these products they need to replicate \u2013 if Kylie Jenner owns it or Taylor Swift tweets about it, there is an incredibly high chance a copy will be more sought after.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, counterfeiters will often use a celebrity ambassador\u2019s image to attract customers and, ultimately, sell their wares. These can be stolen marketing images or entirely fabricated.<\/p>\n<h3>Examples on Taobao<\/h3>\n<p>For example, Zhang Tian Ai is a famous Chinese actress with 9 million followers on Chinese social media site Weibo. Taking advantage of her high profile, one seller on Taobao has used a photo of her with a Louis Vuitton bag alongside a counterfeit version of the same bag. The sale price for this bag is approximately \u00a33.50, and at the time of writing 440 transactions had been made.<\/p>\n<p>In another example, a Taobao seller is offering counterfeit Stuart Weitzman boots by using an image of famous Chinese celebrity Yang Mi, as well as using her name in the listing title. Yang Mi is a famous Chinese actress with approximately 70 million followers on Weibo. All the clothing and accessories she wears usually become very popular and lead to high search volumes across marketplaces and social media. The selling price for the boots in the listing is approximately \u00a315, compared to \u00a3470 on Stuart Weitzman\u2019s official UK website. At the time of writing, 862 successful transactions had been made.<\/p>\n<h3>Walking a fine line<\/h3>\n<p>Clearly there\u2019s a very fine line between good marketing and playing straight into the hands of counterfeiters.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interests to protect a luxury brand\u2019s identity and, while the goal of marketing teams tends to be to increase sales, they also need to ensure the exclusivity of the brand remains in tact. When their products \u2013 real or otherwise \u2013 saturate the market, that exclusivity is gone for good. At the same time, Intellectual Property (IP) lawyers are tasked with legally protecting the brand, which is a hugely complex challenge in the fashion industry. Brands live and die by their creative IP and, if it becomes a common commodity, there\u2019s little that can be done to get it back.<\/p>\n<h3>Coordinated effort required<\/h3>\n<p>While there is no quick fix, tackling the problem requires business units to work together. At first glance it may appear that the marketing team and IP department have little overlap, but any disconnect can compound the issue. Both have useful insights into their respective markets, which can determine the success of campaigns. For example, if IP teams are told when a pop star of the moment is signed as an ambassador, they are immediately in a better position to determine strategies for fighting counterfeits. In fact, IP should be involved from the beginning of any marketing or advertising strategy to advise on legal implications, such as around the trademarks registered against different items and the risks associated.<\/p>\n<p>Lawyers are able to put in place strategies for identifying and dealing with possible counterfeits if they are given greater levels of visibility from the start. They are able to monitor for particular key words, images of the product and celebrity posted by accounts linked to known counterfeiters, as well as illegitimate adverts on social media platforms and so on.<\/p>\n<p>As brands have more marketing tools at their disposal, so too do illegal sellers and it\u2019s imperative that teams work together to tackle the issue. After all, it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest \u2013 the brand, the legal team as well as the ambassador \u2013 to protect the reputation they\u2019ve worked hard to achieve.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.luxurylawalliance.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Luxury Law Alliance<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2188,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The unforeseen consequences of celebrity endorsements | The Luxury Law Alliance - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/the-unforeseen-consequences-of-celebrity-endorsements\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"The unforeseen consequences of celebrity endorsements | The Luxury Law Alliance\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Celebrity endorsements and sponsorship are a key element of many brands\u2019 marketing strategies.
