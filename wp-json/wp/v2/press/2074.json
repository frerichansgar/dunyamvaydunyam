The firm has also hired OVH\u2019s Chris Hardy as chief revenue officer. Hardy was previously senior director of EMEA vCloud Air for the cloud provider.<br \/> The news came as a Tech Nation report revealed that investment in the UK tech sector was continuing to boom despite the looming threat of Brexit. British firms raised \u00a34.5bn last year, nearly twice as much as the year before, the report showed.<br \/> Brooks said he was not concerned about the impact of Brexit on trading, but that it presented recruitment problems. Like many London-based tech firms, INCOPRO has an international staff, including developers from China and multi-lingual analysts. \u201cI think there are some issues around Brexit for talent hiring, but from the business\u2019s point of view in terms of trading I don\u2019t think there is a problem.\u201d<br \/> Commenting on the deal, Highland\u2019s Sam Books said in a statement that he believes the scale of the challenge for brand and IP owners is \u201cenormous and growing in complexity\u201d. \u201cWe have been impressed by the deep domain expertise that Simon, Bret, Helen and the INCOPRO team have leveraged to build such a compelling platform, protecting the interests of some of the best-known brands globally.\u201d<br \/> ____<br \/> To view the original article on New Statesman, <a href=\"https:\/\/tech.newstatesman.com\/business\/incopro-raises-21m-highland-europe-scale-ip-protection-platform\">click here<\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2075,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[140],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Incopro raises $21m from Highland Europe to scale its IP protection platform - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/incopro-raises-21m-from-highland-europe-to-scale-its-ip-protection-platform\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Incopro raises $21m from Highland Europe to scale its IP protection platform\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"London startup INCOPRO has raised $21m from growth equity investor Highland Europe to scale its online brand and IP protection platform.
