This is a \u201cglobal statistic rather than solely UK focused,\u201d a spokesperson told\u00a0Pharmacy Network News.<\/p>\n<p>Bactrim is the only medicine the company performed searches for as part of its October 21\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/how-and-why-search-engines-must-take-responsibility-for-tackling-counterfeiters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">white paper<\/a><\/strong>, though it said the \u2018six in 10\u2019 finding was \u201ctypical\u201d of the searches it performed for other products such as cycle helmets and water filters.<\/p>\n<h2>\u2018Unregulated\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>Google told the company that it is only prepared to investigate companies suspected of selling counterfeit medicines when a brand brings trademark litigation against the infringing site \u2013 a position Incopro said was \u201cworthy of challenge\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Simon Baggs commented: \u201cNot only has uncontrolled purchasing of pharmaceuticals led to epidemics like the opioid crisis in America, it also allows for unlawful operators to sell counterfeit products. These counterfeits pose a direct risk to consumers\u2019 safety due to their unregulated production.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are calling on search engines to do more in de-indexing and acting on counterfeit sellers that appear in their results and protect consumers from harm.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>&#8216;Blatant disregard for public health&#8217;<\/h2>\n<p>A GPhC spokesperson told\u00a0PNN\u00a0: \u201cWhile accessing online health and care services has clear benefits for patients there are inherent risks that need to be managed safely.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe would urge all organisations, including search engines to consider what more they can do to protect people from counterfeit sellers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>MHRA inspection, enforcement and standards policy advisor Lynda Scammell told\u00a0PNN\u00a0: \u201cThe majority of medicines sold illegally online are not counterfeit, nor falsified, but are unauthorised generic medicines which cannot be legally traded in UK\/EEA.
