The research team scanned around four million Instagram posts, identifying more than 56,000 accounts involved in counterfeiting activities \u2013 more than double the 20,000 accounts the same group found in 2016.<\/h3>\n<p>For each luxury brand\u2019s hashtag, around 15 percent of posts were generated by accounts dedicated to illegal counterfeiting activities.<\/p>\n<p>The signs show that Instagram may be struggling to clamp down on the levels of abuse on its platform by groups of organised criminals. It\u2019s not surprising to see more luxury brands frustrated \u2013 not just because it\u2019s so easy to find these accounts, but also because of the lack of proper response to these threats.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram is not alone in this problem, with the likes of\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0having faced the same issues in the past. The problem of counterfeits sold through online marketplaces has become so bad that\u00a0some major brands\u00a0refused to let their wholesalers sell their products through these platforms.<\/p>\n<p>But social media has now become the bigger problem, arguably overtaking online marketplaces as the biggest platforms for the sale of fake goods. As luxury brands realised the power of sites like Instagram, so too have counterfeiters looking to hitch off the back of legitimate luxury goods. These users are enabled further by recent features such as Instagram\u2019s \u201cShop Now\u201d where posts can have listings and item details on the image itself and are directly linked to a store to purchase the product.<\/p>\n<p>Luxury brands suffer the most from these features. Their brand perception means their official channels for purchasing products are either entirely offline in bricks and mortars store, or if they are online, they\u2019re limited to their own e-commerce sites. <strong>However, there is a demand for these products online, and while this may not be their target market and is dismissible by luxury brands, it only gives counterfeiters an easier platform to abuse. If luxury brands want to protect their brand equity and perception, co-operating with platforms such as Instagram is a necessity.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The article quotes Andrea Stroppa who flags that \u201cInstagram is not very responsive.\u201d Interestingly, in our experience with the 600+ brands we work with, Instagram has been very timely in responses. One of our Principal Analysts, Svetlana Ilnitskaya, quotes Incopro\u2019s response time from Instagram being between 12-48 hours and <strong>our compliance rate with Instagram to be close to 99% for the take down of counterfeit issues on the platform \u2013 with 90% of accounts being closed<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, however there is more platforms can do to aid right holders in the identification, collection, and reporting of these infringements as the counterfeiting landscape evolves.<\/p>\n<p>The issue that Ghost Data flags has significantly transformed far beyond user accounts selling counterfeit products. Social media sponsored adverts are now being abused, and the utilisation of bots to automatically create accounts at rapid rates are just a couple of the trends we\u2019ve seen.<\/p>\n<p>The sale of counterfeits is just another issue that social media companies are failing to deal with, sitting alongside terrorist propaganda, self-harm images, the spread of misinformation and many other examples.<\/p>\n<p>New proposals by the government\u00a0could see social media sites fined or blocked if they\u2019re seen as failing to tackle the problem, but the responsibility should already fall on their shoulders without the threat of legislation.<\/p>\n<p>Automated, AI-based brand protection technology ensures that brands can prioritise the top offenders. <strong>By automating the enforcement process, luxury brand owners can save time and achieve impact on the problem.<\/strong> Using these tools in combination with smart automation is the best way to make a real difference.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Please follow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.retailtechnologyreview.com\/articles\/2019\/04\/30\/instagram-struggling-to-deal-with-counterfeit-luxury-goods\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this link<\/a> to read the original article from Retail Technology Review.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2249,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
