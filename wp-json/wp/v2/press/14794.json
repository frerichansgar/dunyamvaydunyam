In the study,&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;analyzed more than 1.5 million automated requests, sent on behalf of 750+ brands between November 2019 and November 2020, asking for illicit offers for sale to be removed across 34 global marketplaces and social sites.&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;found that one in five of its automated requests to remove fake listings related to 3% of illicit sellers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the report, titled:\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/three-strikes-and-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cThree Strikes and Out: How Ecommerce Platforms Can Protect Consumers from Repeat Offenders,\u201c<\/a>\u202fIncopro&nbsp;also explores the connection between repeat sellers of illicit goods and services and the monetary gain that could be secured if online marketplaces and social sites were to implement two baseline requirements: (1) all seller identities should be verified; and (2) all sellers should be removed from the marketplace or social site if identified as selling illicit goods and services on more than three occasions (&#8220;three strikes&#8221;). Implementing a uniform approach could significantly reduce illicit sales and save up to $78B of losses annually.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the pandemic driving an accelerated shift to online retail, it is critical that more is done to protect brands and consumers,&#8221; said Simon&nbsp;Baggs, CEO and co-founder of&nbsp;Incopro. &#8220;We are seeing huge increases in brand misuse, a trend which has already caught the eye of legislators in the United States and Europe. I hope this study will inform and accelerate legislative change, driving a consistent approach to seller verification and sanctions for repeat illicit activity.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to&nbsp;Incopro&#8217;s&nbsp;study:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f The most aggressive, repeated use of ecommerce operations to infringe rights and harm consumers comes from only 3% of illicit sellers.&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;defined this group as sellers whose listings have been flagged to online platforms on more than three separate days.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f 21% of all the removal requests sent to online platforms by&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;concerned the most aggressive group of repeat illicit sellers; hence, one out of five illicit offers for sale are generated by a core of 3% of wrongdoers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f Currently, 68% of the online marketplaces and social sites analyzed (23 of 34) have some policy in place to tackle repeat sellers of illegitimate goods; however, only three of these platforms have publicly announced, strict &#8220;three strikes&#8221; policies that consistently result in banning repeat illicit sellers:&nbsp;Alibaba,&nbsp;Aliexpress, and&nbsp;Taobao.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f A minimum of 11% of all harmful online offers could be stopped immediately if robust seller verification was combined with a consistently implemented &#8220;three strikes&#8221; model (i.e., banning flagged sellers after three separate days of enforcement). This figure rises to 24% if the removal policy were applied more strictly (i.e., banning sellers after three non-genuine listings).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchandmarkets.com\/research\/hzjb9c\/global_brand?w=4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Global Brand Counterfeiting Report,<\/a>\u202fmonetary losses suffered by the public due to online counterfeiting are estimated at $323B annually. If consumers are exposed to 11% fewer non-genuine offers on ecommerce platforms worldwide (per&nbsp;Incopro&#8217;s&nbsp;findings above), this would amount to $35B saved &#8212; and $78B saved with stricter policies. The equivalent revenue would also be captured by the true rights holders selling legitimate products and services.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Added&nbsp;Baggs: &#8220;Nearly two thirds of consumers lose trust in a marketplace after being deceived by a counterfeit seller, according to a recent&nbsp;Incopro\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/2-out-of-3-consumers-believe-that-brands-are-responsible-for-protecting-them-from-fake-products-and-misleading-marketing-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">consumer survey.<\/a>\u202fPlatforms have much to gain from instituting stricter measures that lead to the removal of repeat sellers of illicit goods and services, including a reduced admin workload and increased trust in their own brands.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/three-strikes-and-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> full report<\/a>\u202fis now available for download at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/<\/a>.\u00a0Incopro\u00a0will also host a\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/events-and-webinars\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">webinar<\/a>\u202fto address the research findings in the coming weeks.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Incopro<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incopro\u00a0uses technology to find and remove online brand misuse.
