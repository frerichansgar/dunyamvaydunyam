On Friday, it was mixed, but over the weekend we noticed an increase.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her staff have been wearing visors on the shop floor to help encourage compliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRetailers can enforce the law without challenging people,\u201d she said. \u201cLast week, our staff started wearing shields to give a really strong message, and express that all we are asking from them is to keep us and themselves safe.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Exemption challenges<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Retailers said exemptions are making it difficult to police the rule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those exempt include children aged under 11; those with a physical or mental illness, or a disability; people for whom wearing or removing a mask will cause severe distress; and anyone assisting someone who relies on lip reading to communicate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scottish retailer Hussan Lal told betterRetailing: \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to enforce the rule when people may have a legitimate reason for not wearing a mask.

If you are wary, then you can request to see the certificates to prove the goods are legitimate.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>In-store dining<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers are allowed to take off their masks to eat, drink or take medication, but retailer Mo Razzaq has been discouraging the use of his in-store dining area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owner of a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterretailing.com\/store-profiles\/family-shopper-blantyre\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Family Shopper in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire<\/a>, Razzaq told betterRetailing: \u201cWe\u2019ve asked our customers not to sit in and eat, because it prevents more people being able to enter the store due to the limit.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, he has made disabled customers and emergency workers exempt from this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe want our customers to know we are mindful of how difficult this time has been for them,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Read the original article in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterretailing.com\/legislation-competition\/new-face-mask-rule-england-coronavirus\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">betterRetailing<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":9454,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
