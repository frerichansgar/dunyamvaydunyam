Agelloc Hand Sanitizer Soothing Spray promises \u201cefficient\nprevention of coronavirus\u201d in a photo, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoiding spelling out the claims in the text helps sellers\nskirt algorithms trained to scan and delete products that break the rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers\u2019 trust in Amazon makes that marketing particularly\nhazardous, said Svetlana Ilnitskaya, director of customer strategy of Incopro,\na firm that helps brands protect themselves from intellectual property and\ncopyright theft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#009ca6\">\u201cThe claims are false and it\u2019s really a dangerous place for\nconsumers,\u201d Ilnitskaya said.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Messages from the seller accounts for the Lutos and Agelloc products said the products were aimed at helping consumers stay safe. Neither merchant, nor several others making assertions about preventing the coronavirus, commented on using photos to make those claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon removed the product listings after The Washington\nPost asked about them. The company requires sellers to provide accurate\ninformation, and it has developed digital tools for the coronavirus outbreak\n\u201cto scan the hundreds of millions of product detail pages for any inaccurate\nclaims our initial block may have missed,\u201d spokeswoman Cecilia Fan said in an\nemailed statement. All told, Amazon has blocked or removed more than 6.5\nmillion products, she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington\nPost.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon has struggled for years to police its marketplace.\nThat\u2019s in large part because third-party merchants, not Amazon itself, account\nfor the majority of physical merchandise sold on the site. That amounted to as\nmuch as 58 percent in 2018, Bezos wrote in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.aboutamazon.com\/company-news\/2018-letter-to-shareholders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">letter to shareholders<\/a>&nbsp;last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company routinely grapples with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2019\/11\/14\/how-amazons-quest-more-cheaper-products-has-resulted-flea-market-fakes\/?tid=lk_inline_manual_20&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">a scourge of counterfeit products<\/a>, so much so that the Trump administration announced plans in January to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/2020\/02\/05\/white-house-adviser-accuses-amazons-jeff-bezos-backing-out-meeting-fake-products\/?tid=lk_inline_manual_20&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">begin imposing fines and other penalties<\/a>&nbsp;on merchants, warehouses and e-commerce marketplaces such as Amazon that facilitate the import and sale of counterfeits. The company forbids the sales of cannabidiol on the site, but creative sellers have figured out how to bypass Amazon\u2019s detection, making CBD products&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2019\/12\/19\/amazon-prohibits-cbd-sales-its-still-easy-buy-site\/?tid=lk_inline_manual_20&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">easy to find<\/a>. Former executives have said the company prioritizes selection over preemptively blocking merchants who might violate rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the outbreak began, Amazon has worked to police rogue\nsellers who engaged in price gouging on vital items such as face masks. And the\ncompany has struggled to keep pace with the flood of orders from shoppers leery\nof venturing out of their homes during the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February, Amazon warned sellers about \u201cfalse claims in regards to COVID-19,\u201d and said then it had blocked or removed more than 1 million products for suspect or misleading claims. The company also stopped letting sellers bid on the words \u201ccoronavirus\u201d or \u201ccovid-19\u201d as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2020\/02\/28\/facebook-twitter-amazon-misinformation-coronavirus\/?tid=lk_inline_manual_24&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">keyword in search results<\/a>. In mid-March, the company said it suspended more than 3,900 selling accounts in its U.S. store for violating its fair pricing policies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite those measures, sellers have sidestepped Amazon\u2019s\ndetection for coronavirus-protection claims with images that run along their\nproducts. The seller of Flightbird Disposable Hand Sanitizer Gel,&nbsp;for\nexample, included an image that claims the product \u201ceffectively inhibits new\ncoronavirus.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a message, that seller said \u201cthe product effectively\nkeeps hands clean.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as the coronavirus pandemic is exposing cracks in society \u2014 everything from&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2020\/02\/29\/gig-workers-face-spread-new-coronavirus-with-no-safety-net\/?tid=lk_inline_manual_29&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">sick leave for gig workers<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2020\/03\/16\/schools-internet-inequality-coronavirus\/?tid=lk_inline_manual_29&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Internet inequality for digital learning<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014 it\u2019s also highlighting the shortcomings of Amazon\u2019s limited vetting of sellers on its platform, said Juozas Kaziuk\u0117nas, chief executive of the e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse. The company requires sellers to submit business documents, among other items, to get on the platform. But the ability to obtain those can vary by country, and that\u2019s allowed some dubious international sellers on Amazon\u2019s U.S. e-commerce site, Kaziuk\u0117nas said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe coronavirus has resurfaced a bunch of issues we\u2019ve seen\nabout Amazon in the last several years,\u201d Kaziuk\u0117nas said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon\u2019s Fan said the company\u2019s vetting process uses \u201ca\nproprietary system that analyzes hundreds of unique data points to identify\npotential counterfeit or infringement risk.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers, desperate to acquire hand sanitizer, haven\u2019t been\nkind to the off-brand products on Amazon that have made coronavirus claims.\nSome of the listings were so new they didn\u2019t have customer reviews. But one\nreview for a hand sanitizer from Wenasi called the product \u201cterrible\u201d and added\nthat bottle appeared to have already been used by someone. Another reviewer was\neven more blunt: \u201cThis is pandemic profiteering plain and simple.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon has proved to be a crucial piece of the retail economy during the pandemic when consumers shop from home to avoid the possibility of spreading the coronavirus. The surge of orders has so overwhelmed Amazon that it\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2020\/03\/24\/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-positive\/?tid=lk_inline_manual_36&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_36\">racing to hire 100,000 people<\/a>&nbsp;to work in its warehouses and deliver its packages. And its third-party sellers augment Amazon\u2019s supplies, even though it&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2020\/03\/24\/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-positive\/?tid=lk_inline_manual_36&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_36\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">still remains difficult<\/a>&nbsp;to find brand-name toilet paper and sanitary wipes on the site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even employees at Amazon warehouse across the country have decried the shortage of hand sanitizer, and other cleaning products, as they\u2019ve&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2020\/03\/17\/amazons-warehouse-workers-sound-alarms-about-coronavirus-spread\/?tid=lk_inline_manual_38&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_38\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">raised alarms<\/a>&nbsp;about unsafe working conditions.

Another selling tactic to win over\ncustomers: using the branding of trusted products. The picture for a pump\nbottle of hand sanitizer that Kitt Amino Acid sold was nearly identical to\nPurell\u2019s Soothing Gel product that\u2019s out of stock on the site. One difference,\nthe word Jaysuing, the product brand, is in the spot where Purell\u2019s name\nnormally would be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Food and Drug Administration regulates hand sanitizers\nin the United States as an over-the-counter product, and because of those\nregulations, Purell\u2019s parent company, Gojo, recommends consumers \u201cpurchase hand\nhygiene products from responsible and reputable companies,\u201d company spokeswoman\nSamantha Williams said. While the company is aware of Jaysuing products on\nAmazon, it hasn\u2019t contacted Amazon to remove them, she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Read the original article in <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The Washington Post (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2020\/04\/02\/amazon-bogus-coronavirus-claims\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Post<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":7292,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Amazon vowed to crack down on coronavirus profiteering.
