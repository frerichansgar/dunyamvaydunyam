This means that only authentic units can reach customers, claims the online retail giant. The codes can also contain other information such as the data and location of manufacturing.<\/p>\n<p>It provides some numbers to back up that assertion. 300m codes have been added to products so far, either provided as stickers by Amazon or printed directly onto product packaging, and more than 250,000 counterfeits of products covered by the Transparency programme have been blocked from reaching customers.<\/p>\n<p>So far in 2019, there have been no reports of counterfeits being sold via Amazon sites for products \u201cfully on-boarded into the Transparency service.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The service \u2013 which costs between 1 and 5 cents per code depending on volume, has attracted some endorsements including this from Cowin, a manufacturer of noise cancelling audio devices.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBlocking counterfeits from the source has always been a tough task for us \u2013 it\u2019s something all brand owners face through nearly all channels around the world,\u201d said Cowin chief executive Bill Mei. \u201cAfter we joined Transparency, our counterfeit problem just disappeared for products protected by the programme.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The expansion of the Transparency project comes as Amazon is under increased pressure to tackle the problem of counterfeit goods appearing on its platforms \u2013 something the company\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.securingindustry.com\/amazon-cites-counterfeit-issue-in-2018-annual-report\/s112\/a9191\/#.XSXjGu3Qhpg\">acknowledged<\/a>\u00a0officially for the first time in its 2018 annual report.<\/p>\n<p>Last year the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association (AAFA) even\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.securingindustry.com\/clothing-and-accessories\/clothing-group-wants-amazon-added-to-us-notorious-markets-list\/s107\/a8569\/#.XHkvuNAYBpg\">called<\/a>\u00a0for some of its marketplaces to be included in the next edition of the US Trade Representative\u2019s Special 301 Notorious Markets list because of the problem of counterfeit product listings.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, Amazon has introduced another new anti-counterfeit toolbox \u2013 called\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.securingindustry.com\/amazon-unveils-plan-to-tackle-counterfeit-problem\/s112\/a9377\/#.XSXjsu3Qhpg\">Project Zero<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 aimed at using artificial intelligence and machine learning to seek out and delete suspected counterfeit listings.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, technological approaches such as these are also being supplemented by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.securingindustry.com\/electronics-and-industrial\/amazon-and-nite-ize-file-lawsuit-claiming-counterfeit-sales\/s105\/a10201\/#.XSYBqnt7lpg\">legal actions<\/a>\u00a0against sellers who list counterfeits on Amazon, and the company also set up its Brand Registry \u2013 a platform for registering logos and trademarks to facilitate detection of infringement \u2013 in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Critics have suggested however that the retail giant still needs to do more to protect intellectual property on its platform.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCounterfeits [on Amazon] is a problem that has been growing exponentially year-on-year, with minimal tangible action taken to address the issue,\u201d says <strong>Tosshan Ramgolam of brand protection specialist Incopro.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhilst they have put some initiatives\u2026in place, they are not doing enough to stop the problem.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/counterfeit-products-are-destroying-brand-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Find out how counterfeit products destroy brand value<\/a><\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Read the article on Securing Industry <a href=\"https:\/\/www.securingindustry.com\/amazon-offers-its-anti-fake-serialization-platform-outside-us\/s112\/a10270\/#.XSce8uhKg2x\">here<\/a><\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2257,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Amazon offers its anti-fake serialization platform outside US | Securing Industry - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/amazon-offers-its-anti-fake-serialization-platform-outside-us\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Amazon offers its anti-fake serialization platform outside US | Securing Industry\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Amazon has said it will expand its item-level Transparency coding platform into Europe, India and Canada, two years after it launched in the US.
