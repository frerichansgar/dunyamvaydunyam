But buying items online, especially those that claim to prevent or treat&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/news\/topic\/covid-19\">COVID-19<\/a>, can be a risky move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/impact\/topic\/amazon\">Amazon<\/a>, the largest e-commerce retailer, has been criticized in the past for allowing vendors to sell defective or counterfeit products on its platform. At the start of the current health crisis, that problem became even more apparent. In late February, the company&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-health-amazon-com\/amazon-bars-one-million-products-for-false-coronavirus-claims-idUSKCN20L2ZH\">barred more than a million items from sale<\/a>&nbsp;on its third-party marketplace due to price gouging and false claims related to COVID-19.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean the website is now completely free of fraudulent or misleading product listings. Here\u2019s what you need to know before buying from Amazon, especially products that supposedly protect against the&nbsp;coronavirus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Anti-COVID Products To Avoid On Amazon<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBefore the crackdown, it was really bad,\u201d said Robert Gross, co-founder and COO of&nbsp;Fakespot, a browser plugin that identifies fake product reviews and low-quality sellers. He said there were people selling fake N95 masks, expired masks, herbal remedies and vitamins that claimed to cure COVID-19, and other overpriced, fake or misleading products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These products weren\u2019t being offered by Amazon directly, but rather by its third-party sellers. As of 2018,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2019\/04\/13\/amazons-third-party-sales-are-exploding.aspx\">58% of physical products<\/a>&nbsp;sold through Amazon were from third parties, and Amazon benefits because it doesn\u2019t pay for this inventory upfront. \u201cIt\u2019s a really effective way to have enough inventory all around the world &#8230; an unlimited supply of inventory from these third-party sellers,\u201d Gross added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawback is that it provides an opportunity for scammers to take advantage of the platform. With the proliferation of these types of listings in the wake of the pandemic, Amazon had to temporarily shut down its third-party marketplace and restrict the types of products that are allowed to be sold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNow the problem has resurfaced because they let third-party sellers back on the platform, and they have taken off [some of] the restrictions from COVID products,\u201d Gross said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cStay away from any product that claims to cure or prevent COVID-19. That\u2019s the most obvious sign of a scam.\u201d- Michael Bonebright, Consumer Analyst with DealNews<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Misleading listings aren\u2019t as widespread or egregious as before \u2015 items like fake cures and testing kits have essentially been eliminated \u2015 but you\u2019ll still come across shoddy face masks, sanitizers that don\u2019t meet the CDC\u2019s guidelines for effectiveness and other products with questionable claims. (HuffPost reached out to Amazon for comment regarding what measures it\u2019s currently taking to prevent these types of potentially fraudulent or misleading listings, but the company did not respond.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou might find one or two people trying to get around the system, but Amazon has been very vigilant about shutting those [types of] listings down,\u201d Gross noted. \u201cUnfortunately, problems still exist because these are just general problems with Amazon overall.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When shopping on Amazon, it\u2019s important to remain skeptical, especially when it comes to the following types of coronavirus-related products:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Counterfeit and used medical supplies<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common categories for misleading or fake products is medical supplies,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-sold-out-sellers-warn-counterfeit-masks-coronavirus-2020-1\">including masks<\/a>&nbsp;and face shields. Some medical masks,&nbsp;for example, are listed for sale by poorly rated sellers that have been flagged by Fakespot for&nbsp;fake reviews. The problem with these types of listings is that the products can be overpriced,&nbsp;claim to be more effective than they really are or may actually be used, according to Gross.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Ineffective or counterfeit sanitizing products<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to products like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/entry\/how-to-make-disinfectant-kill-coronavirus_l_5e95fe81c5b6a7e383dfbba5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hand sanitizer and wipes<\/a>, it\u2019s crucial that they meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s guidelines for effectiveness. Unfortunately, a lot of the products sold online don\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A study by online brand protection software provider&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;found <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/six-warning-signs-to-spot-illegitimate-face-masks-hand-sanitizers\/\">272% growth in listings of fake hygiene-related products<\/a> on e-commerce marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Wish in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the equivalent period in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPurchasing these products increases health risks due to consumers believing they are protecting themselves when the products have not been properly tested and are likely to be ineffective,\u201d the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/incopro_data_shows_spikes_in_counterfeit_goods_amidst_coronavirus_pandemic\/prweb17013028.htm\">press release<\/a>&nbsp;stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Ineffective UV sanitizer lights<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon has many listings for UV light sanitizer devices. However, \u201cmany of these devices are cheap fakes that lack the power or spectrum-specificity to work at all,\u201d said&nbsp;Alex Magnin, founder of The Unwinder, which recently published a guide to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/the-unwinder.com\/reviews\/best-uv-sterilizer-light-sanitizer\/\">evaluating UV light sanitizers<\/a>.&nbsp;\u201cPeople are buying and using these products based on the trustworthiness of Amazon, but are not, in fact, killing bacteria and viruses on their phones, pocket goods and household items.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magnin noted that there are multiple listings with images that depict&nbsp;cheap and\/or underpowered LEDs. We found one listing (which has since been removed) that claimed to make the \u201cencironment [sic] safe within 10 seconds\u201d despite&nbsp;no disclosure of wattage and poor positioning of the LEDs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, beware any UV sanitizing product that\u2019s designed for use on your skin. \u201cWe know that powerful UV light can be used to disinfect surfaces that have been exposed to COVID-19. However, you should not buy any product that blasts your skin with UV light, as this can cause skin cancer,\u201d said&nbsp;Michael Bonebright, consumer analyst with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/dealnews.com\/\">DealNews<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Vitamins, supplements and oils<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should avoid any health product with claims that it can prevent or treat coronavirus. \u201cNot a single vitamin, supplement or medication has been proven to prevent or cure COVID-19,\u201d Bonebright said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to products that fall under the purview of the Federal Drug Administration, there is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/consumers\/consumer-updates\/it-really-fda-approved\">extensive guide<\/a>&nbsp;to what the agency does and does not approve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn particular, if a supplement or food claims to affect the structure or function of the human body without evidence, be aware that the FDA doesn\u2019t approve these statements,\u201d Bonebright said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a vitamin C supplement\u2019s label says it protects against scurvy, the statement is OK because studies have proven this to be true, he explained. However, if a Vitamin C label says it protects against coronavirus, the claim is false and against FDA rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. \u201cInformational\u201d books<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you search for coronavirus treatments on Amazon, you\u2019ll likely find several books in the results. However, these generally aren\u2019t worthwhile publications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPeople are selling books about the \u2018COVID cure\u2019 or the \u2018COVID story,\u2019\u201d Gross said. \u201cWhat they are is basically articles people have taken off the internet and put in a PDF.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, these types of publications aren\u2019t written by experts and don\u2019t necessarily contain vetted information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNot a single vitamin, supplement or medication has been proven to prevent or cure COVID-19.\u201d- Bonebright<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How To Spot A Shady Amazon Listing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Amazon has some measures in place to catch scammers and misleading product listings, they\u2019re not foolproof. That means it\u2019s up to you to use your best judgment when shopping on Amazon (or any other online retailer). Here\u2019s what to look out for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Avoid anything that claims it can cure the coronavirus. \u201c<\/strong>Stay away from any product that claims to cure or prevent COVID-19. That\u2019s the most obvious sign of a scam as nothing has been proven to prevent or cure the coronavirus,\u201d Bonebright said. And because fake coronavirus cures aren\u2019t tested or vetted by any authoritative organization, there\u2019s a chance they could actually harm you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examine the photos.<\/strong>&nbsp;Another big giveaway of a fake product is the imagery, according to Gross. For example, the seller may use images that appear across multiple listings from various sites or that don\u2019t match the actual product. \u201cIf the images are off, if something doesn\u2019t seem right &#8230; run,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Double-check the listing\u2019s URL.<\/strong>&nbsp;Gross said that a common practice among fraudulent sellers is to buy existing listings for unrelated products that have a lot of positive reviews and simply swap out the product title and images. They instantly have thousands of glowing reviews, but for something other than what they\u2019re actually selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time you realize you bought a faulty product, they\u2019re gone. One way to easily check if this is happening is to examine the listing\u2019s URL. If you\u2019re shopping for face masks, for example, but keywords in the URL are a book title or something else completely unrelated, it\u2019s likely a fake or ineffective product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find out how long shipping takes.<\/strong>&nbsp;Because the coronavirus originated in China, there has been backlash (likely unwarranted) over products shipped from China. To avoid having their listings ignored in favor of products from the U.S., Gross said some third-party sellers in Asia will say items are \u201cbased in the USA\u201d or \u201cshipped from the USA\u201d when they\u2019re actually not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That could be a sign that the seller is willing to stretch the truth on other details, too. \u201cIf the shipping is not Prime, and it\u2019s going to take a month to get your product, see where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d Gross said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Check seller ratings.&nbsp;<\/strong>Another easy way to avoid getting duped is to review feedback that customers leave for the seller, not just for the product. \u201cActually take the extra 10 seconds to look at the seller,\u201d Gross said. If the seller has poor feedback, you shouldn\u2019t buy from them. \u201cThere are so many great sellers on Amazon that actually deliver what they promise.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be wary of new sellers.&nbsp;<\/strong>\u201cThere\u2019s not necessarily anything wrong with new sellers, but sometimes a new seller is a sign that someone got kicked off the platform and they\u2019re coming back to do another scam,\u201d Gross said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found a listing for a basic plastic face shield (listed at a whopping $189.99) that was posted by a new seller that primarily sells baby clothes \u2014 a reason to be cautious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Look out for price-gouging.<\/strong>&nbsp;In addition to Fakespot, there are other free tools you can use to uncover potentially fake or misleading Amazon listings, including ones that gouge prices to take advantage of panic surrounding the virus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is&nbsp;Keepa, which tracks the price history on Amazon listings. If a product\u2019s price suddenly spikes, it\u2019s a sign that the seller is going against Amazon\u2019s rules and engaging in predatory pricing \u2015 a sign they aren\u2019t trustworthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins such as&nbsp;Honey&nbsp;or&nbsp;Wikibuy&nbsp;can also alert you to other websites that sell the product for a cheaper price, though it\u2019s important to employ the same safety checks above to ensure it\u2019s not just another scam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.co.uk\/entry\/coronavirus-fake-amazon-listing_l_5ed98a53c5b645f05860c2cb\">HuffPost<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":8622,"template":"","meta":[],"press_type":[139],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>5 Anti-Coronavirus Products On Amazon That May Be Ineffective Or Just Plain Fake | HuffPost - INCOPRO<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/5-anti-coronavirus-products-on-amazon-that-may-be-ineffective-or-just-plain-fake-huffpost\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"5 Anti-Coronavirus Products On Amazon That May Be Ineffective Or Just Plain Fake | HuffPost\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"With the&nbsp;coronavirus&nbsp;pandemic still in effect, consumers have turned to online retailers for supplies they can\u2019t find in stores.
