It rapidly spread outside of the university as Chinese citizens, who knew about the event, moved to other parts of the world.<\/p>\n<p>The meaning of the date chosen for the celebration lies in the solitary digit \u20181\u2019. The ultimate solitary day is therefore 11 November (11\/11) and students decided to brighten their day by choosing to derive happiness from buying things instead.<\/p>\n<h3>Adoption at a commercial-scale<\/h3>\n<p>Businesses were quick to take the hint\u00a0with Alibaba on the lead and encouraged the trend by offering huge discounts for the occasion. This made the Singles\u2019 Day the Chinese equivalent of the Black Friday shopping event in the US.<\/p>\n<p>The scale of the event is huge if we consider that last year Chinese shoppers spent $17.8bn (\u00a314.2bn) in 24 hours. Alibaba alone accounted for\u00a0$12bn\u00a0of this revenue, and\u00a0the figure is predicted to grow further this year due to an unprecedented participation of more than 140,000 brands, 40,000 more than last year. International brands make up 60,000 of those taking part<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/deborahweinswig\/2017\/11\/02\/singles-day-2017-preview\/#773218d240a5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Where there is demand of this scale, counterfeits are equally expected to flood the market on this occasion, as Singles\u2019 Day is also renown as China\u2019s biggest day for fake goods.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Since 2013, the rate of complaints regarding faulty merchandise, registered by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce in China, has increased by an astounding 356 per cent.\u00a0The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/deborahweinswig\/2017\/11\/02\/singles-day-2017-preview\/#773218d240a5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regulator reported<\/a>\u00a0that two in\u00a0every five products purchased online in China are either low quality or counterfeited.<\/p>\n<p>The main marketplaces that stand out during Singles\u2019 Day are usually Alibaba, Taobao and Tmall (which are both owned by Alibaba). This year JD.com has also appeared as a new competitor.<\/p>\n<h3>Opportunity for counterfeiters<\/h3>\n<p>How do counterfeiters benefit from Singles\u2019 Day? As online purchases will be booming, new websites will pop up specifically for this particular event. Counterfeiters are able to justify their incredible discounts to consumers as large discounts are expected for the holiday.<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of complaints about goods purchased during Singles\u2019 Day but as returning goods for a refund may be\u00a0difficult,\u00a0consumers usually accept the loss. This gives another incentive for counterfeiters to generate revenue at the expense of the brands, trademark owners or their authorised dealers by producing mass low quality products at a bargain price.<\/p>\n<h3>What can be done by brands?<\/h3>\n<p>There are many ways for brands to help protect themselves but here are three ways to ensure happiness for brands on Singles\u2019 Day.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure that you have your intellectual property rights in place.\u00a0This is probably the most obvious tip but having a strong rights portfolio in the right territories, will make it easier to takedown offenders, especially if the brand is registered internationally.\u00a0Alibaba has established <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alizila.com\/the-facts-about-alibaba-group-and-ipr-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cooperative relationships<\/a> with more than 1,000 major brand owners and several industry associations to enhance the effectiveness of the company\u2019s take down procedures and anti-counterfeiting measures.<\/li>\n<li>Consider other ways of tackling infringement\u00a0such as investing in search engine optimization as part of a marketing strategy, using the delisting function that search engines offer to report infringing websites to remove them from the search results and monitor social media for hashtag abuse.<\/li>\n<li>Last but not least,\u00a0brands can raise awareness among customers regarding the quality of the products they are purchasing. In fact, although online retailers offer deep discounts, figures have shown that customers have lately been more focused on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/c2e47ddc-846a-11e5-8e80-1574112844fd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quality of the products rather than price<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Happy Singles\u2019 Day!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Singles\u2019 Day is probably the youngest cultural phenomenon to have gained widespread observance and recognition<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":857,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[42],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.7 (Yoast SEO v19.1) -
