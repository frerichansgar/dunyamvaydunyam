Key to a successful approach, however, is how you organize data and your team\u2019s ability to collaborate.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/why-intelligence-and-investigations-are-key-to-an-integrated-brand-protection-approach\/\">part one of our Intelligence and Investigations series<\/a>, we discussed the nuances between targeting individual bad actors versus wider networks and shared best practices on gathering online and offline intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this piece, we explore how to organize the data that you collect and how to foster a collaborative approach to ensure your targeted action is effective. As with part one of this series, insights and quotes are from our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/webinar-intelligence-and-investigations\/\">Investigations and Intelligence webinar<\/a> panel: Claire Hendey,&nbsp;<strong>Unilever<\/strong>; Joshua S. Hopping and Helen Saunders,&nbsp;<strong>Incopro<\/strong>; Michael Fuller<strong>,&nbsp;IP Services Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-part-1-data-organization\">PART 1:&nbsp;DATA ORGANIZATION&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve found valid data, the next step is to organize and make sense of it. There are four different dimensions that affect how you organize and store your&nbsp;information and intelligence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"1\"><li><strong>How you physically record it<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Store data electronically to make it easier for you and your team to search, retrieve and share it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Single data storage location<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep all data in one place rather than siloed across multiple locations. Many businesses use case management systems to centralize storage of their information and intelligence.&nbsp;This is about making data easier to retrieve and share later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Use of data warehouse <\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Big spreadsheets of thousands of line items won\u2019t work well in case management systems. This type of data is better placed in a data warehouse&nbsp;&#8211; designed to take large data sets that need to be cross-referenced.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How you work with and visualize data<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you want to make sure that you can&nbsp;manipulate data efficiently and create different views of the data.&nbsp;This helps you to think laterally about what you\u2019re seeing and form connections.&nbsp;An example of this is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/difference\/network-analysis\/\">Network Analysis<\/a> technology &#8211; it\u2019s far easier to see a network of connected infringing entities a diagram than it is in rows of data.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-unilever-s-perspective-on-the-value-of-data-organization\">Unilever\u2019s perspective on the value of data organization<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#009ca6\"><strong>\u201cWhen we work with our providers, they become part of our ecosystem.&nbsp;This is a hub for&nbsp;our Brand Protection&nbsp;function and houses our case&nbsp;management,&nbsp;online&nbsp;data,&nbsp;global trademark portfolio&nbsp;coverage, customs&nbsp;recordal&nbsp;information and&nbsp;more.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Claire Hendey, Global Brand Protection and IP Operations and Systems Manager, Unilever<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An unstructured list of infringers with no context is not useful for Unilever. For Claire, it is therefore critical to enrich the data and extrapolate the issues into strategic impact areas (such as protecting consumer trust in Unilever brands, protecting consumers from harm etc.). It allows Unilever to make an informed decision on how to act and whether to investigate bigger networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unilever expect the matters to be worked on and communicated about within the system, utilizing Incopro\u2019s Brand Protection platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/difference\/talisman-online-brand-protection\/\">Talisman<\/a> to build on what the business holds in its case management system. Claire\u2019s team uses both environments to build a detailed case against high-value targets and bad actor network, with eyes on the whole data flow to utilize for high-impact action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-private-investigator-perspective-on-the-value-of-data-organization\">The private investigator perspective on the value of data organization&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael Fuller, Investigations Department Manager, &amp; licensed Private Investigator, IP Services Inc., states that data organization is key to success. His clients expect him to maintain accurate and accessible case files.&nbsp;Centralizing the data so it can be used and shared is Brand Protection investigations 101.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The value Michael brings to his clients by leveraging historical case work is paramount, keeping the client informed.&nbsp;Michael states that by making the connections to historical targets who disappeared 6 months ago only to resurface, investigators can add critical value to a target by demonstrating their commitment to continuing their&nbsp;nefarious business practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-part-2-collaboration\">PART 2:&nbsp;COLLABORATION&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand owners have a number of issues to tackle and time is limited. As such, it is vital for brands owners to collaborate <strong>1) internally<\/strong> \u2013 between Brand Protection teams and other stakeholders across the business and <strong>2) externally<\/strong> \u2013 between other brand owners, relevant Brand Protection organizations, and authorities. This collaboration ensures consumers are protected and the business sees maximum return on investment from their Brand Protection strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When targeting troublesome bad actor networks, collaboration between brand owners, law enforcement, investigators, and border authorities is crucial to take effective action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-unilever-s-perspective-on-why-collaboration-is-essential\">Unilever\u2019s perspective on why collaboration is essential<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-internal-collaboration\">Internal collaboration<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, Unilever\u2019s global&nbsp;teams were siloed. This limited the impact of Unilever\u2019s Brand Protection activities, with Claire admitting that it made the business slow to act. Collaboration&nbsp;between teams and improved communication was therefore essential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claire states that Unilever\u2019s Brand Protection teams, supply chain, marketing, and IP teams now all work together as task assignees in the business\u2019 internal system to gain valuable input and clarification on actions and ongoing cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom\"><img width=\"397\" height=\"390\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll-Internal-collaboration-with-functions-to-tackle-infringer-networks.png\" alt=\"Poll - Internal collaboration with functions to tackle infringer networks\" class=\"wp-image-9840\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll-Internal-collaboration-with-functions-to-tackle-infringer-networks.png 397w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll-Internal-collaboration-with-functions-to-tackle-infringer-networks-300x295.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom\"><img width=\"389\" height=\"197\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll-Multiple-brands-collaboration-to-tackle-infringer-networks.png\" alt=\"Poll - Collaboration between Brand Protection teams to tackle infringer networks\" class=\"wp-image-9842\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll-Multiple-brands-collaboration-to-tackle-infringer-networks.png 389w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll-Multiple-brands-collaboration-to-tackle-infringer-networks-300x152.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Results of a poll of Brand Protection professionals (September 2020)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-external-collaboration\">External collaboration<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unilever\u2019s wider external&nbsp;stakeholders and third-party&nbsp;providers &#8211;such as outside counsels and investigators &#8212; now work&nbsp;in their ecosystem&nbsp;to share and collaborate on the same data and intelligence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claire states that total collaboration benefits all parties.&nbsp;Third&nbsp;parties are briefed on Unilever\u2019s strategic mission and utilize this to present a picture of the issues back to the business using all the available information that they have.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously there was little integration between online and offline. Unilever now uses the power of data to make larger, connected takedowns. External collaboration is important for the offline space. Claire states that Unilever harnesses its relationships with law enforcement agencies and Interpol\/Europol and non-for-profit organizations such as REACT as they have a large combined global influence and can facilitate on the ground action against bad actor networks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-collaboration-between-brand-owners\">Collaboration between brand owners<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#009ca6\"><strong>\u201cCross collaboration with other brand owners\u2019 groups is key, such as <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/insync-roundtable-how-to-deal-with-problematic-sellers-on-shopee-tokopedia\/\"><strong>INSYNC\u2019s initiatives<\/strong><\/a><strong>.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Claire Hendey, Unilever<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaboration between brand owners represents an opportunity to share insights, best practices, intelligence and high-level data. Through this approach, businesses can target the largest bad actor networks operating online that are exploiting multiple brands and businesses. With combined resources and expertise, brands can take these networks down and protect consumers from harm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, brand owners can also lobby for the changes needed from search engines, social media giants and e-commerce platforms to reduce the incidence of high-risk infringements and make it difficult for bad actors to hide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom\"><img width=\"412\" height=\"495\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll-External-collaboration-to-tackle-infringer-networks.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9846\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll-External-collaboration-to-tackle-infringer-networks.png 412w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Poll-External-collaboration-to-tackle-infringer-networks-250x300.png 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em>Results of a poll of Brand Protection professionals (September 2020)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-private-investigator-perspective-on-why-collaboration-is-essential\">The private investigator perspective&nbsp;on why collaboration is essential<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#009ca6\"><strong>\u201cAs&nbsp;an investigator, we are vested in our client\u2019s successes and are committed to ensuring we protect their interest and support their brand protection initiatives.
