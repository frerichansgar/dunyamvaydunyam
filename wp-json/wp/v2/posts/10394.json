This issue is only exacerbated by search engines, with links to websites that offer counterfeit goods appearing prominently in search results &#8211; an average of<strong> 56.3%<\/strong> of traffic to these sites arrives via organic search[1].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, up to&nbsp;<strong>60%<\/strong>&nbsp;of product results returned by search engines are for websites and other online locations that offer products that are either counterfeit or otherwise infringe intellectual property[2].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines are also intrinsically linked to infringements found on other channels such as marketplaces and social media, with results pages, social posts, and individual listings indexed within search results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-key-threats-to-brands\"><strong>The key threats to brands<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Website infringement presents&nbsp;several critical challenges&nbsp;to businesses, such as:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"1\"><li><strong>High risk of consumer confusion<\/strong> \u2013 Bad actors create mirror sites resembling official sites to trick consumers, use SEO engineering to boost search ranks, and promote phishing websites to steal data.<\/li><li><strong>Difficult enforcement in comparison to social media and marketplaces<\/strong> \u2013 Brand owners face longer response times, uncompliant hosts\/registrars, and infringers that migrate from host to host. UDRP and court actions are often required.<\/li><li><strong>Managing vast domain name portfolios<\/strong> &#8211; Brands are also often pushed to invest in domain name portfolios going far beyond practical business needs in order to try to proactively limit risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-daniel-wellington-case-study-dwstore-ru-dwbutik-ru\"><strong>Daniel Wellington case study: dwstore.ru \/ dwbutik.ru&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the webinar M\u00e5ns Sj\u00f6strand, Head of IP &amp; Brand Protection at <strong>Daniel Wellington<\/strong>, shared an example of two websites &#8211; dwstore.ru and dwbutik.ru &#8211; that were wholly dedicated to counterfeiting and were mirroring Daniel Wellington\u2019s official site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These websites were top ranking on Google and Yandex Russia&nbsp;searches. The Russia-based website host&nbsp;was non-responsive, and the identity of the infringer was initially unknown, complicating enforcement efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The continued operation of the infringing websites represented de facto competition to Daniel Wellington\u2019s local e-commerce&nbsp;performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns mb-0\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom no-styling\"><img width=\"707\" height=\"540\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screenshot-dwstore.ru_-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screenshot-dwstore.ru_-1.png 707w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screenshot-dwstore.ru_-1-300x229.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom no-styling\"><img width=\"657\" height=\"586\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screenshot-dwbutik.ru_-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10423\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screenshot-dwbutik.ru_-1.png 657w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screenshot-dwbutik.ru_-1-300x268.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-normal-font-size\"><em>From left to right: Screenshots of dwstore.ru and dwbutik.ru<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Legal actions against the host, and later against the website owner, were required.

There is a requirement for hosts to act \u201cexpeditiously to remove or to disable access to [illegal] information\u201d once on notice. If they do not act swiftly, they may lose safe harbor protections and be sued for damages (See e.g., Art. 14, E-Commerce Directive 2000\/31\/EC.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google\u2019s stated intent, on the other hand, was to fight any attempt to use legal process to address trademark infringements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-why-does-it-matter\"><strong>Why does it matter?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterfeiting causes financial and reputational to brand owners, gives rise to wider social and economic impacts, and funds wider criminal activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prevalence of websites selling counterfeit goods, including potentially harmful goods, also puts consumers at greater risk. And search engines play a decisive role in enabling the discovery of these dangerous websites and web pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201c[De-indexing]<\/strong> <strong>is<\/strong> <strong>simple, not very costly and within reach of a moderately experienced programmer\u201d <\/strong>(Hamburg Regional Court, Max Mosley v Google Inc.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other contexts, intermediary injunctions are effective \u2013 there is the potential to \u2018scale-up\u2019 and tackle operators with global reach. There is a need for a \u201cmulti-pronged\u201d approach&nbsp;and greater collaboration between search engines and brand owners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent poll of Brand Protection experts, an overwhelming majority<strong> (83%)<\/strong> believe that the law in the US and Europe should change to require Google to do more. This supports the argument that brand owners feel regulatory pressure is the best means of enacting change \u2013 in many cases, platforms still refuse to go above and beyond what the law requires of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-bottom\"><img width=\"378\" height=\"181\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Poll-Should-the-law-in-the-US-Europe-change.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Poll-Should-the-law-in-the-US-Europe-change.png 378w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Poll-Should-the-law-in-the-US-Europe-change-300x144.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded has-text-color\" id=\"h-part-3-google-s-new-policy-what-has-changed-and-what-brands-need-to-know\" style=\"color:#009ca6\"><strong>PART 3:&nbsp;Google\u2019s new policy \u2013 what has changed and what brands need to know&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In June, Google significantly shifted its policy &#8211; Court Orders are no longer required to notify Google of trademark infringements&nbsp;and have them removed from search results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands concerned about trademark infringing webpages appearing in organic search can now notify Google using the Legal Shooter Form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-good-news\">The good news&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It is encouraging to see Google responding to lobbying pressure&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>The Legal Shooter Form represents a new weapon for brands to use in website enforcement &#8211; especially against uncompliant hosts and registrars.

We also support this stance \u2013 it will enable brand owners to work out whether the tool can be used effectively and allow them to provide feedback to Google on how it can be improved.
