The burden therefore lies on brand owners to identify and report&nbsp;the infringements to the platform.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strong platform relationships are therefore key to protecting consumers from harm and ensuring a long-term reduction in brand abuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-prioritizing-key-platforms-and-sellers\"><strong>Prioritizing key platforms and sellers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Where<\/em> your consumers shop and <em>who<\/em> they purchase from are key considerations when choosing the platforms you prioritize and develop robust relationships with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A seller linked to&nbsp;multiple infringements that does not actually shift any product is less of a problem than someone who has robust, proven sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one consumer product&nbsp;on eBay, we surveyed the total number of related listings and sales &#8211; new items from distributors, grey market items, counterfeits, and used items. We identified approximately <strong>1,280<\/strong> separate listings offering the item for sale.&nbsp;The majority of&nbsp;listings were non-infringing. But we found that just 5 eBay listings &#8211; which were using SEO and ads to drive traffic &#8211; accounted for<strong> 25%<\/strong> of the sales volume on eBay for that product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"522\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Sales-Volume-Comparison-Product-on-eBay-1024x522.png\" alt=\" Sales Volume Comparison for product on eBay\" class=\"wp-image-8288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Sales-Volume-Comparison-Product-on-eBay-1024x522.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Sales-Volume-Comparison-Product-on-eBay-300x153.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Sales-Volume-Comparison-Product-on-eBay-768x392.png 768w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Sales-Volume-Comparison-Product-on-eBay.png 1231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon is likely to be one of the platforms that you prioritize as it is the most popular e-commerce platform with US consumers &#8211; approximately <strong>38%<\/strong> of U.S. e-commerce takes place on Amazon. And the e-commerce giant plays a huge role in Europe, Japan, India, Mexico, Australia, Canada, and Brazil, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you might be more interested in key regional players if you are selling into certain territories. You need to know where the key regional players where your consumers are based. If you are monitoring the Latin American market, Mercadolibre and OLX might be your focus. Whereas Walmart and Craigslist might be the platforms you prioritize in the US.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your industry, you may contend with distinct consumer purchasing habits and this will have a direct impact on which platforms you prioritize. If you are in the licensing space, Etsy becomes a major player. Poshmark is a major platform for fashion; not for electronics or toys. It is critical to focus on the platforms most likely to affect your industry.<strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-building-relationships-with-key-platforms\">Building relationships with key platforms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have identified the key platforms for monitoring and enforcement, brands should seek to engage with them directly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>1. Establish key contacts and organizing regular meetings<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Through these relationships, escalate concerns and expedite enforcement action in time-sensitive scenarios by bypassing the platform notice sending tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2. Sign-up for the platform\u2019s Brand Protection programme and tools<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;A core tenet of building a successful relationship is to understand the inner workings of a platform. Communicate with their&nbsp;team to understand how they work and provide frank feedback on what works well and what can improve. This helps evolve the tools at your disposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>3. Using brand protection technology, monitor infringement trends and changes in behavior<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to use data you\u2019ve collected to facilitate comprehensive intelligence sharing. This way you\u2019ll be able to provide insight on infringement trends to help shape the platforms\u2019 overall strategy and influence any large-scale restructuring required to stop infringement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>4. Engage the platform at events and webinars<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider inviting the platform to participate on panels and webinars alongside your brand to discuss how you are working in collaboration to protect consumers and clean up the online marketplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A combination of direct communications, full understanding of the platform, and intelligence sharing means your enforcement efforts are strategic and more likely to be successful. Compliance and platform response times both improve when a strong relationship has been built between platform and brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-building-relationships-with-emerging-platforms\">Building relationships with emerging platforms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that infringers behavior is&nbsp;constantly&nbsp;evolving and&nbsp;they adopt to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;detection and&nbsp;enforcement.&nbsp;The ability to alert and advise platforms on these trends is essential to keeping up with bad actors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When engaging emerging platforms, we suggest taking the following approach as part of your relationship building exercise:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts in the support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;and other infringing products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation<\/li><li>Inform the platform about the risks posed by bad actors using listings to divert consumers to external sites (such as WeChat) to complete transactions<\/li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what established platforms are doing&nbsp;<\/li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many emerging platforms will only accept legal documentation that is translated into their native language \u2013 having strong relationships means brands can negotiate the simplification of this documentation to speed up enforcement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-need-for-platform-relationships\">The need for platform relationships<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent poll asked 68 business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals to rank the global and regional platforms most challenging for their brands. The most challenging platform was Amazon (<strong>32%<\/strong>), closely followed by Alibaba (<strong>24%<\/strong>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"581\" height=\"526\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Most-challenging-platforms-Poll-results.png\" alt=\"Most challenging platforms - Poll results\" class=\"wp-image-8291\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Most-challenging-platforms-Poll-results.png 581w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Most-challenging-platforms-Poll-results-300x272.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlighting the need for stronger relationship building with key platforms, the same poll found that <strong>48%<\/strong> believe their relationship with Amazon is either \u2018negative\u2019 or \u2018could be better\u2019.
