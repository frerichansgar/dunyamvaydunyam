However, brands are often more uncertain as to why they should feel <em>proud<\/em> of a successful strategy.<\/h2>\n<p>Online Brand Protection allows brands to reduce the level of online infringement and increase their sales. However, working with large amounts of data and numbers when pursuing bad actors online, can lead brand protection teams to lose sight of just how important their work is and why they should be proud of a successful strategy.<\/p>\n<p>With an intelligence-led solution that can significantly reduce the level of IP infringements, you are ensuring lasting impact for your brand by safeguarding customers\u2019 health; protecting and increasing your revenue;\u00a0and rebuilding online reputation. In this piece, we detail the four key reasons businesses should be proud of a successful Online Brand Protection strategy:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Protecting your customers from\u00a0harm<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/3.3-world-trade-counterfeit-1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>By employing a comprehensive brand protection strategy, businesses are protecting their customers from dangerous, sometimes lethal counterfeited products. Examples of dangerous counterfeits are widespread, including fake phone chargers exploding and causing fires, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/blog\/christmas-2018-dangerous-fake-toys-and-electronics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fake toys found to contain carcinogens<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/blog\/counterfeit-car-parts-risking-lives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vehicle brake pads made of grass<\/a>. Successful brand protection means identifying the large-scale networks operating against your brand and enforcing against them, rather than taking down individual listings or accounts ad-hoc, causing minor inconveniences rather than a lasting impact.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re being proactive, you\u2019re being responsible and putting the consumer\u2019s safety and wellbeing front and centre; most businesses are not.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Protecting reputation and ensuring brand longevity<\/h3>\n<p>Brand reputation is difficult to build, but easy to erode. Trust in brands is continuing its swift descent with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.research-live.com\/article\/news\/half-of-consumers-dont-know-which-brands-to-trust\/id\/5024292\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3% year-on-year fall<\/a> of consumer trust in UK brands. Most significant, however, is that almost half of UK consumers struggle to work out which brands they can trust.<\/p>\n<p>The volume and availability of online counterfeits linked to a brand impacts the company in question\u2019s image. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/blog\/how-counterfeit-goods-destroy-brand-reputation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent survey<\/a>, 76% of consumers said they would be less likely to purchase from a brand whose reputation was associated with counterfeits. Therefore, rights holders that are able to significantly reduce the level of infringement and minimise their association with counterfeiting will be able to safeguard their hard-won brand image.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, a brand can choose to take command of the message and build a reputation with investors, suppliers and licensees for being proactive in tackling infringement, rather than just reacting to customer complaints as and when they receive them. This is particularly beneficial if a business\u2019 competitors aren\u2019t engaged in a successful brand protection strategy themselves, allowing a brand to position itself as the industry leader in protecting consumers both online <em>and<\/em> offline.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Preventing damage to sales and converting customers<\/h3>\n<p>Successful brand protection must be able to demonstrate ROI. If a brand is able to prevent loss of sales to online infringers, they may also be able to convert some counterfeit buyers into customers. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/quantitative-impact-brand-protection-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study conducted by Oxera<\/a>, on behalf of Incopro and working with one of our customers, found that for every infringing social media account taken down, approximately 0.7-0.8 additional sales were generated as a result. Online Brand Protection is also able to<a href=\"\/reports\/the-total-economic-impact-of-talisman\/\"> increase your online sales by 3% each year<\/a>, per brand covered, according to results of a commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Incopro in 2019. Lost sales can also be recouped through converting certain unauthorised sellers and merchandisers to official partners, allowing you to reach audiences and channels previously untouched by your brand.<\/p>\n<p>By preventing lost sales and converting new customers, you can change perceptions internally that a brand protection team is a cost centre within your organisation.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Shutting down counterfeiting networks linked with modern-day slavery<\/h3>\n<p>Counterfeiting operations are frequently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.interpol.int\/Crime-areas\/Trafficking-in-illicit-goods-and-counterfeiting\/Trafficking-in-illicit-goods-and-counterfeiting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">run by organised criminal networks<\/a> whom engage in human trafficking and modern-day slavery. Working conditions are dangerous within counterfeiting sweatshops, with labourers being exposed to toxic materials such as the mercury and arsenic found in fake cosmetics. Labourers often receive no pay, having been forced into their situation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/frontline\/article\/inside-the-hidden-reality-of-labor-trafficking-in-america\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to repay their debts to human traffickers<\/a>, and they are often physically threatened by those running the criminal operations.<\/p>\n<p>Brands can however, use technology to link online sellers, IP addresses and physical premises together, gathering actionable data in which to aid law enforcement and specialist offline organisations , such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wri-group.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WRi<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beijingeastip.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beijing East IP<\/a>, in dismantling these criminal networks. As a result, vulnerable members of society are protected from exploitation and those responsible are put behind bars.<\/p>\n<h2>Develop a successful brand protection strategy<\/h2>\n<p>At Incopro, we work with our clients to create effective Brand Protection strategies, leveraging our expertise in <strong>intellectual property, criminal intelligence and technical design<\/strong>.
