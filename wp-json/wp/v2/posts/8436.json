We then look at how the owners have responded to market changes \u2013 specifically the creation of \u2018branded\u2019 face masks in light of the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, we highlight how an intelligence-led approach will allow you to enforce at a network level to shut down similar operations that target your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-is-an-infringer-network\">What is an infringer network?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First, some context on infringer networks. Criminals often act as part of wider interconnected networks that are akin to large, multinational businesses in the way they operate \u2013 they have suppliers, distribution channels, run marketing campaigns and \u2018employ\u2019 individuals to promote the products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-how-do-infringer-networks-operate\">How do infringer networks operate?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad actors utilize a combination of digital channels including social media, marketplaces, and e-commerce websites to sell their illegal products to large volumes of consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Large-scale counterfeit networks are known to evolve very rapidly to counteract enforcement efforts and are adept in shrugging off ad-hoc takedowns. Utilizing a number of different domains, accounts, and listings, bad actors react quickly to channels that are closed down &#8211; they are quickly replaced and the counterfeiting activity continues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded has-text-color\" id=\"h-part-1-evolution-of-an-infringer-network\" style=\"color:#009ca6\">Part 1: Evolution of an infringer network<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last 5 years, Incopro has monitored a large-scale network that distributes counterfeit soccer shirts\/jerseys, tracksuits, socks and vests. We\u2019ve documented its behavioral changes to see how it reaches consumers and the methods it has employed to successfully avoided enforcement techniques from third parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2016-the-network-spreads\">2016 \u2013 The network spreads<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/the-rise-of-social-media-in-counterfeiting-uefa-euro-2016-football-shirts\/\">In 2016<\/a>, the network &#8212; already in existence for several years &#8212; began to expand its operation in the run up to the 2016 European Championships. We identified 80 connecting parts with clear linkage to one company operating by selling fake soccer shirts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>47 website domains (at the time, 27 were active)<\/li><li>17 Social Media Accounts:<ul><li>4 x Facebook<\/li><li>3 x Skype<\/li><li>3 x WhatsApp<\/li><li>3 x Twitter<\/li><li>1 x Pinterest<\/li><li>1 x Google+<\/li><li>1 x YouTube<\/li><li>1 x LinkedIn<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>1 Marketplace Store<\/li><li>17 email addresses<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The network\u2019s structure at the time is mapped below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized clear-top\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Counterfeiting-network.png\" alt=\"Counterfeiting network\" class=\"wp-image-895\" width=\"580\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Counterfeiting-network.png 700w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Counterfeiting-network-300x249.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><figcaption>Blue highlighting indicates the ad-hoc enforcement attempts by a third party which did little to disrupt the network<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2018-the-network-responds-to-enforcement-attempts\">2018 \u2013 The network responds to enforcement attempts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/counterfeit-networks-operate\/\">During the 2018 World Cup<\/a>, there was little wholesale change to the structure of the network &#8211; we identified six Facebook accounts and thirty-three websites, although very few of them were the same as had been operating previously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the tournament our analysts noted that if a website was closed, the social media accounts simply switched their promotion efforts to another within the network and the infringement continued unhindered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2020-the-network-consolidates-its-internal-structure-and-starts-hijacking-genuine-websites-to-promote-counterfeits\">2020 \u2013 The network consolidates its internal structure and starts hijacking genuine websites to promote counterfeits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, the network continues to evolve. The key changes in behavior that we have observed over the last year include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The owners have stopped using brands within domain name as these were easy to identify and take down using trademark law<\/li><li>The owners are now using hacked genuine websites to divert traffic to their storefront<\/li><li>The operation is now consolidated to 4 main mirror websites \u2013 down from almost 50 two years ago<\/li><li>The network now promotes face masks with club insignia printed on the fabric \u2013 in response to COVID-19<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-use-of-hijacked-websites\">Use of hijacked websites<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We identified that the owners of this network are hacking into WordPress-based websites to redirect traffic to their storefronts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They create new pages that contain \u2018cheap football shirts\u2019 or similar within the URL slug and the page header so that they will appear for these searches. These pages are then subsequently indexed by search engines, at which point the hacker removes the pages from the website. When a user visits these hacked URLs via a search engine, they immediately hit a 404 page which has been set to redirect to the counterfeiter\u2019s storefronts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-top\"><img width=\"637\" height=\"379\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Hijacked-websites-statistics.png\" alt=\"Hijacked websites statistics\" class=\"wp-image-8448\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Hijacked-websites-statistics.png 637w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Hijacked-websites-statistics-300x178.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px\" \/><figcaption>This sophisticated hacking operation targets websites across a wide range of industries and is designed to ensure the counterfeit shopfronts receive traffic from consumers across the globe<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The network\u2019s owners have targeted a number of websites from a variety of territories to hijack. As the map below shows, hijacked websites are based in countries across all continents. As a result, the network\u2019s storefronts are able to maximise their global reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"455\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Global-map-of-hijacked-sites-1024x455.png\" alt=\"Global map of hijacked sites\" class=\"wp-image-8447\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Global-map-of-hijacked-sites-1024x455.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Global-map-of-hijacked-sites-300x133.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Global-map-of-hijacked-sites-768x341.png 768w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Global-map-of-hijacked-sites.png 1318w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Most of the hijacked websites identified are located in the US, UK, and Germany<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-brands-targeted-by-network\"><strong>Brands targeted by network<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We looked at the scale of infringement and types of products on offer to get an accurate idea of the number of brands affected by the network. We found the following number of entities were impacted directly or indirectly:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>League\/Other football competitions: 15<\/li><li>Teams: 256<\/li><li>Kit suppliers: 32<\/li><li>Sponsors (all sponsors): 226<\/li><li>Payment providers: 4<\/li><li>Shipping providers: 3<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although some of these brands are not being counterfeited directly (I.e. a kit sponsor has been removed from a counterfeit jersey or pair of shorts), association with this criminal industry alone has a negative impact on brand reputation \u2013 some operations have been shown to directly fund serious crimes such as terrorism and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/the-true-cost-of-counterfeit-goods\/\">human trafficking<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-facemasks-new-products-hijacking-demand-created-by-covid-19\"><strong>Facemasks: New products hijacking demand created by COVID-19<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Infringers will adapt and exploit any change in the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the postponement of the 2020 European Championship due to COVID-19, the network\u2019s owners have had to find another event or trend to produce new merchandise for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social distancing measures are gradually easing, but the use of face masks by the general public will likely remain. It is widely expected that spectators will be required to wear face masks for their own safety when they are allowed to return to sports matches. In some countries, including the UK, the general public is also mandated to wear face masks on public transport &#8211; fans may also want to wear their team\u2019s colors when traveling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Face masks, therefore, have proved to be the perfect product trend for this network to latch onto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterfeit soccer kit poses risks to brand reputations and revenues. However, illegitimate face masks go one step further and put consumers\u2019 health at serious risk. Undergoing no testing or certification and tied directly to the brand and sponsors, these masks are likely to be completely ineffectual in protecting the wearer and others around them from COVID-19.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom\"><img width=\"896\" height=\"311\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Unlicensed-face-masks-1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of unlicensed face masks\" class=\"wp-image-8453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Unlicensed-face-masks-1.png 896w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Unlicensed-face-masks-1-300x104.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Unlicensed-face-masks-1-768x267.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-top\"><img width=\"869\" height=\"313\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Unlicensed-face-masks-2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of unlicensed face masks\" class=\"wp-image-8454\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Unlicensed-face-masks-2.png 869w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Unlicensed-face-masks-2-300x108.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Unlicensed-face-masks-2-768x277.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px\" \/><figcaption>Network\u2019s shopfront offering illegitimate face mask that use the iconography of both national and domestic soccer teams (June 2020)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded has-text-color\" id=\"h-part-2-how-to-take-down-large-scale-networks\" style=\"color:#009ca6\">Part 2: How to take down large-scale networks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus your resources on identifying and enforcing against large-scale networks &#8211;&nbsp;the biggest threats to a brand are well organized infringer networks that can infiltrate consumer touchpoints wherever they are based in the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Equip your business with the technology to monitor their digital activity &#8211;&nbsp;<\/strong>Infringer networks\u2019 online operations and activity&nbsp;leaves a&nbsp;data footprint, despite best efforts to cover their tracks.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Ensure this technology can connect&nbsp;the&nbsp;data&nbsp;from all&nbsp;sources&nbsp;\u2013<\/strong>&nbsp;Not only do you need to detect&nbsp;the data&nbsp;but you also need to connect the&nbsp;right data&nbsp;together to build a true picture of the size and reach of a network.
