The franchise, valued at over US$1billion, faces pirate streams, downloads, torrents and fake DVDs. But it is also victim to trademark infringement, with the series\u2019 signature typeface regularly being re-appropriated in unrelated advertisements and digital media, even appearing in the US president\u2019s tweets. As with any popular franchise, HBO has also had to contend with counterfeit merchandise available online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the epic saga now concluded, we break down the online infringements that have followed in its wake and showcase how the scale of the issue has increased as the show has grown in popularity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-the-threat-of-piracy\">The threat of piracy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HBO has been locked in a war of attrition with online pirates since airing the first season, with the stakes continually being raised. In a turn of events with consequences akin to the Red Wedding, the first four episodes of season five were leaked by a media source before the premier and made their way onto pirate websites. This was a serious blow for HBO and undoubtedly led to revenue loss for the premium television network and its partners such as Sky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, HBO has been increasingly cautious as to whom in the media it permits sending early-screening versions of episodes to. To guarantee no aspect of season 8\u2019s secretive production leaked, the show\u2019s actors were only given scripts for scenes involving their characters and had to access these scripts on &#8216;firewall protected&#8217; iPads<span style=\"font-size: small;\">1<\/span>. No hard copies were ever distributed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst HBO has been successful in preventing major leaks over the last two seasons and has increased its subscriber base, it has not been able to effectively fight online piracy once episodes aired. Season 7\u2019s premiere saw more than 90 million combined illegal downloads or streams in the first 72 hours<span style=\"font-size: small;\">2<\/span>. And whilst final three-day data is yet to be released, the season 8 premiere is well on track to beat this previous record, with almost 55 million pirated views across illegal streams, downloads, and torrents in the first 24 hours<span style=\"font-size: small;\">3<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-false-association\">False association<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HBO only owns the standard character mark for the phrase \u2018Winter is Coming\u2019 in physical goods classes, meaning that the TV network would have no basis in which to claim infringement for most uses online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are instances where HBO\u2019s rights are potentially infringed; take Donald Trump\u2019s recent tweet for example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"clear-bottom has-small-font-size\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Trump-infringing-tweet.png\" alt=\"\"><br><em>Donald Trump\u2019s tweet from January 2019. *Season 7 spoiler ahead* As an aside, it is ironic to invoke The Wall in Game of Thrones, a structure which was somewhat blown apart by an undead dragon.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using an almost identical typeface to that of the series and attempting to emulate the smoke-filled backgrounds seen in Game of Thrones promotional posters and thumbnails, Trump is treading a thin line in regard to intellectual property infringement. It would be difficult to argue that there is no attempt at association with the TV show, given the messaging of the poster and overall creative execution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty in bringing a lawsuit against the President is that it is unclear as to whether there is close enough association, with the defendant likely to argue it falls under fair use or parody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-countless-counterfeits-and-unlicensed-goods\">Countless counterfeits and unlicensed goods<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em>Jaqen H&#8217;Ghar is one of the Faceless Men, a shadowy group of assassins able to change their appearance at will. The counterfeiters of the world of Ice and Fire, if you will.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typing \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 into an online marketplace will result in pages upon pages of \u2018inspired\u2019 clothing and other merchandise, with some of this being fan-made by independent artists. Provided these articles do not use HBO\u2019s trademarks, they are not infringing and can be argued to somewhat benefit the rights holders by increasing the show\u2019s online visibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, much of what purports to be official \u2018merchandise\u2019 is unlicensed and guilty of trademark infringement by using the character marks \u2018Winter is Coming\u2019 and \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019, and appropriating the show\u2019s well known \u2018circular bar\u2019 typeface. Much to the approval of the Faceless Men, these fakes often fool the well-intentioned consumer into thinking they are genuine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterfeit merchandise is of lower quality, with discounted prices often the key giveaway of authenticity; there is also little way of knowing where the article came from and the conditions of those that produced it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image clear-bottom\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Unlicensed-t-shirts-1024x703.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to an infringing sponsored item appearing at the top of a search for the term \u2018Winter is coming\u2019, the first two organic results are unlicensed products which infringe the character mark \u2018WINTER IS COMING\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-how-can-large-franchises-protect-their-ip\">How can large franchises protect their IP?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Media productions need to be aware of the scale of online infringement affecting their IP. Instead of relying on manual legal enforcement, rights holders should use a technology-based solution to root out trademark abuse and copyright infringement, and sophisticated piracy databases to take down illegal streams and downloads.
