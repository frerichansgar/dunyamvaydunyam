In a year where the tech giants will be under increased regulatory focus in multiple geographies&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the&nbsp;massive&nbsp;growth of their&nbsp;influence&nbsp;over society, there is a real opportunity to drive change in the way that platforms work with brands to protect consumers \u2013 and collaboration will be key to taking advantage of these trends.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">1. 2021 Brand Protection Goals&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With&nbsp;shifting&nbsp;priorities&nbsp;and a fast-moving&nbsp;online environment, we asked the INSYNC Community for&nbsp;their teams\u2019 Brand Protection goals&nbsp;in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>&nbsp;Protecting intellectual property understandably remains as a core goal &#8211;

Increasing collaboration internally<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite, or perhaps&nbsp;<em>because of,<\/em>&nbsp;the changing threat landscape, the number one strategic priority for 2021 is increasing collaboration internally \u2013 with&nbsp;<strong>64%<\/strong>&nbsp;citing this as a priority.&nbsp;Brands who have succeeded in building cross-functional collaboration&nbsp;typically see increased awareness of the role protecting brand can play in business success \u2013 ensuring alignment with business goals and in many cases&nbsp;easing budget constraints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2-monitoring-new-platforms-or-digital-channels\"><strong>2. Monitoring new platforms or digital channels<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, the platform landscape continued to evolve, with rapid user growth driving increased focus on platforms like&nbsp;Pinduoduo&nbsp;or&nbsp;Tiktok, and the&nbsp;rise of social commerce meaning brands need to be ready to adapt&nbsp;their strategies rapidly. However, in a world with constrained budgets, brands will need to continue to&nbsp;prioritise&nbsp;the key channels&nbsp;that matter to their business and&nbsp;consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-3-addressing-new-online-threats\">3. Addressing new online threats<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The accelerated shift online in 2020 has driven many brands to re-appraise their focus \u2013 moving&nbsp;beyond IP infringement and counterfeiting to address broader threats to the&nbsp;online&nbsp;consumer relationship,&nbsp;from negative association to price gouging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-4-shifting-focus-from-offline-to-online-protection\">4.

Whilst for some this means shifting budgets, for others the focus will be better leveraging online intelligence to drive the efficiency of their offline operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>While the threat landscape facing each brand will be different, the&nbsp;transformation driven by&nbsp;COVID should drive all teams to review their strategies to ensure the most effective use of their resources to protect their brand and consumers.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">3.&nbsp;Platforms:&nbsp;a key focus for 2021<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following high-profile action taken&nbsp;by platforms&nbsp;against&nbsp;then-President Trump, tech giants&nbsp;are&nbsp;once again under&nbsp;the microscope for&nbsp;the role they play in&nbsp;facilitating&nbsp;prohibited and harmful content.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Law makers are&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;moving&nbsp;towards&nbsp;increased&nbsp;regulation&nbsp;for social media platforms, deeming them to be publishers&nbsp;rather than mere platforms that host third-party content.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any changes to the regulatory landscape&nbsp;are&nbsp;likely to have far reaching consequences for the Brand Protection community&nbsp;\u2013 potentially making it easier for brands to have infringing content&nbsp;removed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul start=\"4\"><li>1. Survey respondents&nbsp;cited a range of challenges that will be familiar to brand protection experts \u2013 from managing constrained budgets and the need to prioritize, to improved engagement with enforcement agencies or adopting the right enforcement strategy to deliver impact and avoid playing whack a mole.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul start=\"5\"><li>2. However, the most common theme was around the&nbsp;policies and working practices of platforms, where many respondents&nbsp;cited continued challenges&nbsp;in protecting their consumers.&nbsp;Though 2020 saw improvements in some areas \u2013 for instance proactive enforcement of&nbsp;COVID-related issues &#8211;&nbsp;the&nbsp;policies and responsiveness of platforms remains a critical&nbsp;step in the journey to protecting consumers online.&nbsp;Improvements across five key areas were highlighted on the 2021 wish lists from the INSYNC community:<br><br>a. Improved responsiveness to takedown notices<br><br>b. Increased penalties for repeat offenders<br><br>c. Improved working relationships with platforms in APAC<br><br>d. Improved data sharing of bad actor intelligence<br><br>e. Proactive&nbsp;monitoring &amp;&nbsp;protection&nbsp;from platforms&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul start=\"6\"><li>3. 2021 will see&nbsp;significant regulatory focus on platforms across multiple geographies&nbsp;\u2013 from anti-trust cases&nbsp;in the US and EU&nbsp;to broad-focused reviews of the online space such as the Digital Services Act in the EU or the UK\u2019s Online Harms review. Whilst&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;initiatives such as the Shop Safe Act in the US focus&nbsp;purely on Brand Protection issues, it is critical that the community speaks with a united voice to ensure the changes brands need to protect their consumers online are heard loud and clear.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"heading-branded\">We asked the&nbsp;INSYNC Community for their 2021&nbsp;Wishlists&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&nbsp;is&nbsp;a selection of quotes that our respondents provided, reinforcing the strategic priorities&nbsp;outlined&nbsp;above:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>\u201cLeveraging our online intelligence to efficiently provide leads for offline&nbsp;action\u201d&nbsp;<\/li><li>\u201cIncreased collaboration between Legal and Marketing to&nbsp;deliver a comprehensive&nbsp;program\u201d&nbsp;<\/li><li>\u201cStronger action from marketplaces on repeat offenders\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cMore proactivity from platforms&nbsp;and increased sharing of bad actor intelligence\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cMore staff and&nbsp;more budget!\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>\u201cMore buy in&nbsp;from the big platforms and entities that create the internet&nbsp;globally\u201d&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">4.&nbsp;Conclusion&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As for many others, 2020 was a year of significant challenge for the&nbsp;Brand&nbsp;Protection community, but&nbsp;the transformation&nbsp;that has occurred has created the opportunity for 2021 to be a year of meaningful change and growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-brand-protection-more-central-to-digital-strategy\"><strong>Brand&nbsp;Protection more central to digital strategy<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With an increased focus on the online space and brands\u2019 digital presence, brand protection has become more central to brands\u2019 digital strategies \u2013&nbsp;driving much needed improvements in awareness and collaboration.&nbsp;Brand protection&nbsp;teams must remain proactive in engaging their businesses, and&nbsp;speak the language of the marketing, e-commerce and security to&nbsp;secure the collaboration and budget needed to&nbsp;succeed.&nbsp;As we hope to emerge&nbsp;from the impact of the pandemic, teams will need to review and refocus strategies to ensure they are meeting the needs of their brand and consumers in the transformed online world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-cross-brand-collaboration-is-critical\">Cross-brand collaboration&nbsp;is&nbsp;critical&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While brand protection teams can and must&nbsp;reorganize&nbsp;internally and revise strategies to respond to the rapidly changing environment, platforms will remain a key part of the puzzle&nbsp;not obviously within their control. But in an environment&nbsp;where existing approaches are under the microscope from regulators, there is an opportunity&nbsp;to drive change through cross-brand collaboration&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;both in working with regulators and the platforms themselves. Whilst a single brand can struggle to effect change on their own, the strength of brands together&nbsp;has the potential to make a real difference.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>We look forward to working with the INSYNC community&nbsp;to achieve these aims in 2021&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;helping to&nbsp;make the internet better for businesses and the consumers.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-become-an-insync-member\">Become an INSYNC Member<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Join a growing network of Brand Protection practitioners and help us build a united front against bad actors.
