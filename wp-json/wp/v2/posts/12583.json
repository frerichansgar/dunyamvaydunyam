Did Nicholas Cage actually rescue the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/machine-learning-algorithm-ai-nicolas-cage-movies-indiana-jones\/\">Ark of the Covenant<\/a>? Two pressing questions we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll agree. Especially as they highlight the growth of \u2018deepfaking\u2019 in today\u2019s society, which in turn can call into question the very nature of reality itself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is \u2018deepfaking\u2019? Well, the headline is that it involves the use of publicly available (and often free) software to swap faces in videos. No need for expensive Hollywood studios or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/2020\/08\/28\/1007746\/ai-deepfakes-memes\/\">deep programmer knowledge<\/a>, which means they\u2019re now appearing everywhere \u2013 and further questioning our concept of \u2018authenticity\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-what-does-any-of-this-have-to-do-with-brand\">What does any of this have to do with brand?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, aside from the sheer joy of watching <a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/l86qDWH\">Mr Dafoe play Barack Obama or Michael Jackson<\/a>, it\u2019s a topic that helps establish a point of view: that authenticity is fast becoming one of your company\u2019s most valuable and fragile assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example over half (59%) of 16-24s are more likely to buy fashion brands <a href=\"https:\/\/www.retail-focus.co.uk\/generation-z-want-to-see-authenticity-in-their-fashion-brands-but-what-does-this-mean\/\">they consider authentic<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authenticity however is an asset that needs to be protected as much as it needs to be inspired. Today, brands live and grow in an open and connected world of online marketplaces, social media, and almost limitless choice. A place where everyone has a voice, making it feel at times like the Wild West!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-from-doing-to-stopping\">From doing to stopping<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to building authenticity, our instinct as marketers is to act, to create, and to communicate. That\u2019s because we know from past experience that acting and behaving in the right way is key to building deep consumer trust. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingcharts.com\/brand-related-112432\">recent research highlights<\/a> that 59% of consumers are looking for brands that act responsibly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet such activities have a significant limitation: they\u2019re not addressing one of the core factors negatively impacting your brand\u2019s authenticity: bad actors. These come in many shapes and sizes, but each has the potential to fake your brand, to serve up replica websites and products that severely compromise existing customer relationships \u2013 and cast doubt on your brand\u2019s authenticity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is that today brands have a real responsibility to protect themselves and their customers. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/2-out-of-3-consumers-believe-that-brands-are-responsible-for-protecting-them-from-fake-products-and-misleading-marketing-content\/\">According to recent research conducted by Incopro<\/a>, 69% of consumers believe that brands have a responsibility to protect them from fake products or communications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, 56% of consumers said they would struggle to trust a brand after coming across fake products or communications from them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for marketers to add a fifth \u2018P\u2019 to their toolbox: Protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-minimizing-the-negative\">Minimizing the negative<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Protecting a brand is no easy task, especially when you consider the channels and choices open to consumers. Take for example social media, which on the surface is the ideal platform for \u2018getting authentic\u2019 and being at your most open. The trouble here is that it also helps simplify the act of impersonation where anybody working under an assumed name, and backed up by freely available images, can slip into the shoes of even the world\u2019s largest brands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that they stop there. Once in place these bad actors can use your brand to attack people, or post views and opinions contrary to what your company stands for. And with the growth of \u2018Instashopping\u2019 (blended social media and ecommerce platforms) they can also run fake ads and direct your customers to fake websites in what amounts to a phishing exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why we believe that defending against such malicious activity should, in part at least, fall under the remit of marketing: because by offering such protection you\u2019re also strengthening brand authenticity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-building-up-your-defenses\">Building up your defenses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The task of identifying and taking down counterfeit products, fake sites, and illegitimate communications does of course sound like a problem for the legal department. Yet the reality today is that in the eyes of the consumer, one bad experience can compromise their entire relationship with a brand \u2013 even if you\u2019re eventually proven to be innocent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shifting some of this responsibility over to marketing, along with the necessary tools and capabilities, also helps develop a solid platform for improving protection across 3 distinct levels:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Protection from fake communications that can reduce or compromise your brand\u2019s genuine voice<\/li><li>Removing the potential for fake products to damage a consumer\u2019s perception of you<\/li><li>Enforcing your duty of care as a brand to help minimize the risk of fake and potentially dangerous products getting into a customer\u2019s hands<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That alone should gain the attention of the brand-conscious marketer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-summing-it-all-up\">Summing it all up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Authenticity isn\u2019t something that\u2019s created, rather it\u2019s a brand treasure that requires careful protection. Doing that today however is as much about minimizing a consumer\u2019s experience of the negative, as it is about promoting the positive. Particularly when trust and authenticity play such a key role in any purchase decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined, these factors help highlight the critical need for a fifth \u2018P\u2019 in marketing. Keeping it real matters \u2013 wouldn\u2019t you agree Mr Dafoe?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns heading-branded\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded has-text-color\" id=\"h-the-5th-p-of-marketing-consumer-research-report\" style=\"color:#009ca6\">THE 5TH P OF MARKETING \u2013 CONSUMER RESEARCH REPORT<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Download the consumer research report to learn how to build and protect your brand\u2019s authenticity online.
