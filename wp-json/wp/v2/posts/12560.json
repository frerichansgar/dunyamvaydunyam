Not that Calvin Klein are alone in seeking more meaningful, original, and genuine interactions with target audiences. The market is awash with stories promoting the importance of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedrum.com\/news\/2019\/10\/10\/why-marketers-must-look-within-create-authentic-brand-experiences\">building trust and unleashing your \u2018authentic voice\u2019<\/a>. The question of course is how\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Striving for trust and authenticity \u2013 6 key ingredients<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per Monsieur Sartre and Ms Eilish\u2019s comments, authenticity and trust are qualities that are virtually impossible to fabricate. Instead, they emerge from the collective actions, passions, and purpose a company exhibits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, there\u2019s an organic element to authenticity that defies efforts to control or coerce it. For brand owners, such a realization helps move the emphasis away from obsessively trying to \u2018generate\u2019 authenticity. Instead, efforts should be aimed at cultivating the behaviors and attributes needed to create experiences that lead to deeper and more trusting relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing this however can be difficult, even in the best of circumstances when you control every customer touchpoint. It\u2019s also a task that\u2019s made more complex when you factor in the fakes, as well as those impersonators skillfully imitating your brand, your products, and your interactions with the outside world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying authentic therefore requires consistent effort, and below we highlight the 6 key considerations to inspire your next steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-1-take-people-with-you\">#1 Take people with you<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing the glitzy window dressing of your brand is one thing, but giving people access to you backstage elicits an entirely different response. Not that this should be surprising: consumers are after all buying into you as much as they\u2019re buying your products, and they want to know what they&#8217;re getting in return. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to give people the inside scoop, and to show them the \u2018what\u2019, \u2018how\u2019, and (most importantly) the \u2018why\u2019 driving your ambition. When they understand your motivations, they\u2019re more willing to trust you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2-be-open-and-transparent\">#2 Be open and transparent<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Few brands can openly claim to get <em>everything<\/em> right. For the rest, decisions and actions are taken with the honest intention of being better\/smarter\/cheaper etc. When mistakes do happen though, consumers have little patience for brands that attempt to \u2018stage manage\u2019 the fall out. Instead the emphasis needs to be on honesty, on holding your hands up, admitting your error, and detailing a fair response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-3-keep-it-real\">#3 Keep it real<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Authenticity can come in a variety of different forms, many of which emerge from the same fundamental source: the ability to be relatable. Yes, it\u2019s important to offer the aspirational, but practical, pragmatic, and relevant are also valuable currencies \u2013 especially when they\u2019re able to connect with and reflect the demands of real-life situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-4-stick-to-your-guns\"><strong>#4 Stick to your guns<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand values are some of the hardest qualities to impersonate. Counterfeiters can of course replicate your best sellers, but they can\u2019t deliver them in the same inimitable way. Not if you remain consistent with what your brand stands for and offer a premium experience that helps to continually reinforce this credibility. Consistency mixed with a clear and relevant purpose makes for a powerful concoction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-5-embrace-your-back-story\">#5 Embrace your back story<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The myriad factors, personalities, and actions that shaped your company from origin to awesome are a true source of unique. Sharing this heritage through thoughtful and interesting stories helps generate substance, backing up your brand\u2019s \u2018right\u2019 to adopt an exclusive position \u2013 while giving that authentic feel to everything you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-6-show-you-genuinely-care\">#6 Show you genuinely care<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many brands say they care about their customers, to the point that it\u2019s almost become a stock \u2018tick in the box\u2019 statement. Consumers though can quickly tell the genuine from the spin, as they seek responsible and compassionate firms to build long-term relationships with. People expect high standards from their favourite brands, which in turn have a powerful responsibility to protect this trust from any bad actors or experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Summing it all up\u2026<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Authenticity and trust are delicate and intangible qualities to define. But they can, and have been by French philosophers, American singer songwriters, and consumers \u2013 based predominantly on their personal notions of what feels truly genuine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more, authenticity is becoming more important by the day, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.retail-focus.co.uk\/generation-z-want-to-see-authenticity-in-their-fashion-brands-but-what-does-this-mean\/\">Gen Z seeking it out in ever-greater numbers<\/a>. Why this is, is a question best left for the psychologists and social commentators, but to end (as we started) with a quote: \u201cHard times arouse an instinctive desire for authenticity\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So said Coco Chanel who, if we didn\u2019t know better, seemed to be coining a phrase with 2020 very much in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns heading-branded\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded has-text-color\" id=\"h-the-5th-p-of-marketing-consumer-research-report\" style=\"color:#009ca6\">THE 5TH P OF MARKETING \u2013 CONSUMER RESEARCH REPORT<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Download the consumer research report to learn how to build and protect your brand\u2019s authenticity online.
