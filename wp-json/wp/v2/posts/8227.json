A focused, deliberative strategy is needed to reduce infringement on key platforms and tackle large-scale criminal operators.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss how to prioritize and work with key platforms to reduce the volume of infringement. We then guide you through the tools at your disposal, allowing you to deliver against your Brand Protection goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded has-text-color\" id=\"h-part-1-how-to-prioritize-platforms-to-review\" style=\"color:#009ca6\">Part 1: How to prioritize platforms to review<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to pick your battles and focus on&nbsp;threats that are&nbsp;most&nbsp;damaging to your brand&nbsp;and&nbsp;also&nbsp;where you are&nbsp;most&nbsp;likely to see ROI from your enforcement action.&nbsp;While Incopro discovers, prioritizes, and acts against infringements across platforms of all sizes, we find that over 80% of&nbsp;high-risk&nbsp;infringements occur&nbsp;on around 20 key platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When&nbsp;determining your focus there are three key points to consider:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-1-protect-consumers-and-brand-value-eliminate-counterfeit-product-visible-to-potential-consumer\">1. Protect consumers&nbsp;and brand value:&nbsp;eliminate counterfeit product visible to potential consumer&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Understand where your potential consumers shop.&nbsp;A good starting point is to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;key popular e-commerce platforms in each&nbsp;market&nbsp;and keep them clean from infringing product.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep an eye on the emerging platforms: the way consumers shop online is constantly evolving.&nbsp;Social Commerce is not a new concept, but COVID-19 has really&nbsp;accelerated&nbsp;the process &#8211;&nbsp;2020 could be the year&nbsp;to watch as many&nbsp;social media&nbsp;platforms are&nbsp;investing in seamless&nbsp;commerce&nbsp;experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-2-protect-your-own-e-commerce-channels-and-support-authorized-partners-eliminate-consumer-diversion-from-official-selling-channels\">2. Protect your own e-commerce channels and support authorized partners: eliminate consumer diversion from official selling channels:&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Protect Official Websites:<\/strong>&nbsp;the majority of&nbsp;consumers are likely arriving at your website via organic or paid searches for your brand&nbsp;and products. Focus&nbsp;on first pages of Search Engines&nbsp;and&nbsp;Paid Search&nbsp;results;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Official Social Media Channels:<\/strong> audit social media platforms to eliminate impersonating pages and ads that cause consumer confusion;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Official and authorised Marketplace stores:<\/strong> focus on marketplace platforms where your brands have their own stores. Focus on top pages of results, top selling products and categories, sponsored listings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a good place to engage your e-commerce and marketing teams&nbsp;that are likely to be the first ones to see the benefits of your enforcement efforts and be advocates of your brand protection program.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-3-tackle-the-source-of-the-problem\">3. Tackle the source of the&nbsp;problem:&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on the platforms in the regions known for manufacturing counterfeits.&nbsp;B2B&nbsp;platforms and wholesalers are often the source of the counterfeit product ending up on the consumer facing markets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-take-a-strategic-approach-to-platform-enforcement\">Take a strategic approach to platform enforcement<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Concentrating&nbsp;enforcement&nbsp;efforts on priority platforms and&nbsp;priority&nbsp;concerns will lead to&nbsp;better Brand Protection outcomes. The more you focus on a platform and knock-out infringement networks, the more effective your enforcement will be, allowing you to establish an effective deterrent against them coming back.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is best to carve out specific goals around specific platforms, brands, products, IP, infringement types, etc. and to try to tackle the specific problem fully with the aim of sending a clear, credible message to counterfeiters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>A comparison of strategic enforcement versus non-strategic enforcement on 5 example platforms:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-top\"><img width=\"689\" height=\"515\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Volume-of-infringement-non-strategic-enforcement.png\" alt=\"Volume of infringement - non-strategic enforcement\" class=\"wp-image-8235\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Volume-of-infringement-non-strategic-enforcement.png 689w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Volume-of-infringement-non-strategic-enforcement-300x224.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px\" \/><figcaption>Under the non-strategic approach, enforcement is spread out across all platforms, infringement types, and sellers. &nbsp;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large clear-top\"><img width=\"690\" height=\"515\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Volume-of-infringement-strategic-enforcement.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8238\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Volume-of-infringement-strategic-enforcement.png 690w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Volume-of-infringement-strategic-enforcement-300x224.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" \/><figcaption>Under&nbsp;a&nbsp;strategic approach, we are looking to target reductions in a&nbsp;particular type of infringement&nbsp;or on a particular type of platform.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded has-text-color\" id=\"h-part-2-how-to-prioritize-infringements-found-on-different-platforms\" style=\"color:#009ca6\">Part 2: How to prioritize infringements found on different platforms&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve narrowed down the focus of your Brand Protection program, you&nbsp;need to&nbsp;consider the strategy that will allow you to&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;balance the&nbsp;two aspects:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-1-reduce-visibility-of-counterfeit-products-b2c\">1.

With time we see these tools evolve to address new infringer behavior with pressure from the brand owners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of this include the Facebook Commerce&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ads&nbsp;IP tool that identifies infringing ads on Facebook and Instagram and changes to the Amazon Brand Registry to address&nbsp;broader marketplace&nbsp;policy violations and introduce AI features to assist with proactive monitoring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-platform-limitations\">Platform limitations<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, these&nbsp;tools are not fully caught up to provide a&nbsp;robust&nbsp;response mechanism to emerging threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Amazon BR and Alibaba IPP tools are useful when it comes to sending out enforcements and getting items actioned quickly, they&nbsp;are not&nbsp;enough&nbsp;on their own because they do not provide robust capabilities for:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Collecting comprehensive data and getting&nbsp;visibility on the scale and types of problems on a platform.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Prioritization&#8211;organizing&nbsp;and grouping infringements for efficient&nbsp;enforcement;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Identifying infringement networks and recurring activity; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Maintaining records&nbsp;of the items that have been actioned&nbsp;and&nbsp;reporting.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Talisman, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/difference\/talisman-online-brand-protection\/\">Incopro\u2019s Brand Protection platform<\/a>,&nbsp;is a complementary tool that ensures that brands have all the data they need related to infringements and a way to easily export material for efficient enforcement using the platform tools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded has-text-color\" id=\"h-part-4-how-to-address-new-threats-from-emerging-platforms\" style=\"color:#009ca6\">Part 4:&nbsp;How to address new threats from emerging platforms&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Social commerce is capturing demand for seamless consumer interactions, particularly from millennials and generation Z. Social media&nbsp;platforms are&nbsp;fast transforming from serving as a social marketing&nbsp;tool&nbsp;to&nbsp;e-commerce with users never having to leave the platform.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary players in social commerce are Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook and now also&nbsp;TikTok.&nbsp;TikTok, for example,&nbsp;has started to allow some users to add links to e-commerce sites to their profile biography as well as the ability to easily send their viewers to shopping websites.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers are also being pushed to other platforms, including standalone e-commerce shops, such as Shopify which are easy to set up and maintain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-strong-platform-relationships-are-essential\">Strong platform relationships are essential<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Many platforms claim they are not in a position to police themselves, both in terms of labor and technology capabilities, and the burden is still on IP owners to report&nbsp;the infringements.&nbsp;Maintaining strong relationships with both established and emerging platforms is therefore critical to successfully reducing infringement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands should engage with platforms regularly and have direct contact with their&nbsp;team to understand how they work, and&nbsp;to be able to provide feedback on what works well and what can improve. Compliance and platform response times improve when you take the time to educate the platform about your brands.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that infringers behavior is&nbsp;constantly&nbsp;evolving and&nbsp;they adopt to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;detection and&nbsp;enforcement.&nbsp;The ability to alert and advise platforms on these trends is essential to keeping up with bad actors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When engaging emerging platforms, we suggest taking the following approach as part of your relationship building exercise:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts: support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;<\/li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;<\/li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-key-takeaways\">Key takeaways<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"1\"><li><strong>Consider which&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;to&nbsp;tackle&nbsp;first based on where your consumers are, the volume of issues, your commercial objectives&nbsp;and how much impact you need to make to reduce your problem.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Engage with the platforms in a positive way, embrace their tools and&nbsp;give them&nbsp;feedback&nbsp;about&nbsp;where you would like to see them improve.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Keep an eye on the new and emerging platforms&nbsp;in case you need to add those to your top&nbsp;platform list.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With the huge challenges facing all businesses as the world rapidly moves to online retail, consumer trust in digital channels is critical. There has never been a more important time to revisit how you approach protecting your brand and consumers on e-commerce platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incopro can help you successfully prioritize and work with key platforms, enabling you to take a strategic approach to enforcement.
