Ads offer counterfeit products a level of credibility, fooling many consumers into thinking they are purchasing goods sourced from official channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These scam sites often disappear without a trace after the seasonal demand drops-off, leaving consumers out of pocket and unable to replace their low-quality product in time for the festivities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-fake-licensed-goods-haunting-marketplaces\">Fake licensed goods haunting marketplaces <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Costumes and fancy dress are singled out by counterfeiters due to their increased demand, particularly during high profile seasonal events such as Halloween. Many of the products purchased this Halloween will be costumes, with a large percentage of these based on popular films, TV shows, video games, and comics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterfeit costumes are made from low-quality materials and may easily tear. PIPCU warns that fake children\u2019s costumes may even contain flammable materials, putting them at grave risk<small class=\"rte-smalltext\">[3]<\/small>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands must act; consumers spurned by counterfeits will direct the majority of their criticism at the brand rather than the platform. Incopro research finds that 66% of consumers who have been ripped off by fakes have lost trust in a brand after unintentionally purchasing counterfeit goods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Identifying counterfeit or unlicensed costumes can be a difficult task for consumers. The following red flags should be widely communicated by brands to consumers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price<\/strong> &#8211; fake costumes are listed for prices as low as \u00a33.99<\/li><li><strong>Typos or grammatical mistakes within the listing &#8211; <\/strong>spelling mistakes of the product or brand name are intentional to deceive consumers<\/li><li><strong>Seller address and item location \u2013 <\/strong>the listing may claim to be domestic stock but is actually shipped from overseas (or if the seller\u2019s business address is registered overseas)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Examples of commonly counterfeited outfits this year<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our analysts have identified a number of counterfeit and unlicensed costumes heading into Halloween. \u2018Joker\u2019 was released earlier this month and a quick scan of eBay revealed countless unlicensed costumes, with DC and Warner Bros. yet to release official merchandise for the record-breaking movie. IT Chapter 2 was released in September and faces a similar issue. The infringing listings are likely enforceable, with sellers using stills from the films (these images are protected by copyright) and registered trademarks without permission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image clear-top\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eBay-fake-Pennywise-costume-1024x553.png\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption><em>An example of a suspicious listing on eBay UK<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image clear-top\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eBay-Business-selller-1024x165.png\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption><em>The seller is registered in China despite offering \u2018UK stock\u2019<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-counterfeit-cosmetics-tricking-consumers\">Counterfeit cosmetics tricking consumers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cosmetics are also a popular target for bad actors. $69 million worth of fake cosmetic and pharmaceutical products were seized in the US in 2017, making up 6.5% of all counterfeit seizures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-colored lenses are often used as a finishing touch to Halloween costumes. Fake contact lenses are widely available, with PIPCU and the US government warning against their purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-harmful-contact-lenses-available-at-halloween\">Harmful contact lenses available at Halloween<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterfeit contact lenses are particularly dangerous as they can permanently damage a user\u2019s eyes, either through incorrect usage (contact lenses are usually prescription only) or due to the materials used. Counterfeit contact lenses seized in the US earlier this year were found to contain lead[4].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other fakes have been found to contain toxic materials such as cyanide, arsenic, lead, mercury and, in some cases, even rat excrement[5]. These harmful ingredients will cause skin irritation, rash or infection, and many are linked to a higher risk of cancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image no-styling clear-top clear-bottom\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Harmful-ingredients-in-counterfeit-cosmetics_RGB.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><\/a><br>The warning signs of counterfeit products below should be well-communicated by brands to consumers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Packaging &#8211; <\/strong>there are no pictures of the packaging or the listing states \u2018without original packaging\u2019,<\/li><li><strong>Use of stock photos with no photos of the product taken by the seller<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-so-how-can-brands-tackle-seasonal-threats\">So, how can brands tackle seasonal threats?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When brands rely solely on platform-tools to remove counterfeits, they risk falling into the trap of the \u2018whack-a-mole\u2019 approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Platforms can also be slow to respond to takedown requests. With time of the essence, this can be frustrating for brand owners who need listings removed before a seasonal event such as Halloween.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to effectively fight sophisticated counterfeiters, action needs to be at a network-scale and focused on taking down entire operations rather than individual listings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-online-brand-protection-key-to-reducing-infringement\">Online Brand Protection key to reducing infringement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands must be prepared to face seasonal threats from online infringers; it is critical to factor in holidays, sales and other events throughout the year into your brand protection strategy.
