Businesses have the means to succeed in protecting their brands &amp; consumers online and to seize on the opportunity offered by increased e-commerce activity:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>42%<\/strong> growth in e-commerce [1]<\/li><li><strong>227%<\/strong> increase in internet usage (UK) [2]<\/li><li><strong>82%<\/strong> of respondents saw increased online threats<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">2020: Three key trends&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 created a unique set of challenges for&nbsp;Brand&nbsp;Protection teams, with consumers exposed to increased online risks at a time&nbsp;when working remotely and often with reduced teams. Nonetheless, these pressures appear to have raised awareness of the importance of&nbsp;protecting brands online, increased collaboration internally, and in a surprising number of cases led to increased budgets \u2013&nbsp;and these trends can provide insight for the whole Community on strategy in 2021.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-1-increased-threats-online\">1)&nbsp;Increased&nbsp;threats online&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>82%<\/strong>&nbsp;of respondents&nbsp;saw increase in both volume and&nbsp;type&nbsp;of&nbsp;online&nbsp;threats&nbsp;they were facing.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>As ever, bad actors responded rapidly to changing consumer&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;and demand,&nbsp;capitalizing&nbsp;on increased time&nbsp;spent online with an explosion of phishing scams and&nbsp;counterfeit products appearing in categories never previously attacked.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2-protecting-brand-online-viewed-increasingly-as-strategic-priority\">2)&nbsp;Protecting brand online viewed increasingly as strategic&nbsp;priority&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>78%<\/strong>&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;that&nbsp;online&nbsp;Brand&nbsp;Protection had become more important strategically&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;and of these, over&nbsp;<strong>80%<\/strong>&nbsp;of respondents said they had increased collaboration with different functions.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>For many sectors directly impacted by the pandemic \u2013 pharmaceuticals or household cleaning products, for instance \u2013 addressing the increased threat online became a C-suite issue and drove&nbsp;close collaboration between legal and&nbsp;marketing&nbsp;teams.&nbsp;But with the increased online sales, even brands in hard-hit-sectors such as fashion saw the importance&nbsp;of protecting sales online when&nbsp;online became the only channel.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-3-budget-changes-a-mixed-picture\"><strong>3)&nbsp;Budget changes&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;a mixed picture<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>While budgets have come under pressure across all businesses,&nbsp;<strong>36<\/strong><strong>%<\/strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;respondents&nbsp;had seen&nbsp;some level of increase to budgets, while&nbsp;<strong>27%<\/strong>&nbsp;had seen budgets increase significantly.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>However, this left over a third of brands facing increased threat levels with&nbsp;flat or reduced budgets \u2013 increasing the pressure on already under-resourced&nbsp;brand protection teams.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li>Budgets have clearly been impacted by overall business performance, with more discretionary sectors most negatively impacted.
