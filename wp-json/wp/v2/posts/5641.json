Equally, counterfeit cosmetics are rife, putting consumers in direct contact with harmful ingredients. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <strong>45%<\/strong> of the world\u2019s population now active social media users (The Next Web 2019), online counterfeiting poses a greater risk than ever to consumers and brands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Social media influencers found promoting counterfeits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>5% of US consumers admit to paying for fake\nfollowers on social media (a tactic deployed by some budding influencers), highlighting\nthat misrepresentation is a widespread issue online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of prominent influencers have previously been found to be promoting counterfeit products. Either turning a blind eye or remaining unaware of the true nature of the products, these high-profile social media users have peddled fake goods to millions of their loyal followers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, influencers Emma Cakecup and Oltean Vlad were revealed to be promoting websites that offered counterfeit products such as watches[2] to a combined follower base of over 1 million consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there have been several cases involving\ninfluencers knowingly promoting counterfeit goods, there are many online\npersonalities that simply do not verify products, possibly leading to the sale of\ndangerous counterfeit goods from ecommerce sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 2019 BBC investigation[3], three well-known influencers were asked to promote a fake diet drink that contained cyanide, a highly toxic chemical. The trio agreed despite not trying the drink or understanding the dangers posed by the ingredients within.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<h3>The emergence of social buying platforms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>30% of online shoppers now say&nbsp;they would be likely to make a purchase from a social media network like Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter or Snapchat[4]. Infringers have recognized the adoption of social buying platforms across the globe, and now use them to promote fake versions of leading branded products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Established platforms such as Facebook, WeChat and Douyin [5] have inbuilt or planned ecommerce functionality. Infringers use this to link products in their posts to ecommerce sites. They then promote these posts and use targeted advertisements to expose fakes to a wider audience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image no-styling\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"254\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Marketplace-Icon_RGB-300x254.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Marketplace-Icon_RGB-300x254.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Marketplace-Icon_RGB.png 629w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Group-buying platforms such as Pinduoduo are\nalso fast emerging with consumers grouping together to purchase products in\nbulk, at a discount, direct from manufacturers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media platforms without ecommerce functionality are also key hunting grounds for counterfeiters, with 60% of Instagram users&nbsp;saying they find new products on the platform[6].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad actors direct consumers to low-profile, illegitimate websites. Often, users are sent links via private message to transactions on services such as PayPal, AliPay or other equivalents. This provides a further headache for brand owners and warrants the use of advanced image-matching technology to locate the sellers responsible. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How brands can combat social media infringers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>29%<\/strong> of US consumers believe brands should be doing more to stop the purchase of counterfeit goods online, according to Incopro research. Brands must take a two-pronged approach to protect consumers from harmful fakes on social media. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Collaboration<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s imperative to build strong working\nrelationships with social media platforms, join anti-counterfeiting\nassociations and work alongside law enforcement to tackle large-scale criminal\nnetworks operating globally. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insights into infringer activity and\nconcealment tactics can be shared and acted on together. For example, social\nmedia platforms can allow investigators access to closed groups to locate\ninfringers and shut down their operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. Consumer awareness<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers must also be made aware of the dangers of purchasing fakes and how to spot them online. Incopro research reveals that 29% have purchased or would consider purchasing fake toys \u2013 counterfeits with potentially devastating consequences if given to children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumer awareness campaigns that span across brands&#8217; digital channels are critical. These campaigns should contain guides that tell consumers how to spot counterfeits and the official channels that they should only purchase from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some brands go one step further by providing an online form or tool on their website for consumers to report suspected counterfeit items. This alerts a brand to the existence of a particularly visible and high-risk product that could easily be purchased by unwitting consumers, enabling them to remove it quickly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns bg-grey--light\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Join a bigger gang<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands shouldn\u2019t have to bear the brunt of criminal activity online. That\u2019s why we are driving forward the agenda for closer collaboration between brands, platforms, and regulators. Only with a concerted, joint effort, can sophisticated global criminal networks be prevented from burying their roots into online platforms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk to one of our experts today to learn how Incopro&#8217;s technology can help you identify and remove the large counterfeiting networks exploiting your brand on social media.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"cta-button align-left\">\n    <a href=\"\/demo\" title=\"Request&#x20;your&#x20;Demo\"  class=\"btn btn--primary caret-btn\">Request your Demo<\/a>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"677\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Join-A-Bigger-Gang-2-1024x677.jpg\" alt=\"Brand protection - Incopro\" class=\"wp-image-3894\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Join-A-Bigger-Gang-2-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Join-A-Bigger-Gang-2-300x198.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Join-A-Bigger-Gang-2-768x508.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Join-A-Bigger-Gang-2-1536x1015.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Join-A-Bigger-Gang-2-2048x1353.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h5>REFERENCES<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https:\/\/ghostdata.io\/report\/Instagram_Counterfeiting_GD.pdf\">https:\/\/ghostdata.io\/report\/Instagram_Counterfeiting_GD.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[2] <a href=\"https:\/\/eurobsit.eu\/the-role-of-influencers-in-selling-counterfeit-products-online\/\">https:\/\/eurobsit.eu\/the-role-of-influencers-in-selling-counterfeit-products-online\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[3] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/newsbeat-50837267\">https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/newsbeat-50837267<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[4] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.co.uk\/blog\/social-commerce\/\">https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.co.uk\/blog\/social-commerce\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[5] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prweek.com\/article\/1664878\/in-video-search-new-opportunity-influencer-marketing-douyin\">https:\/\/www.prweek.com\/article\/1664878\/in-video-search-new-opportunity-influencer-marketing-douyin<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[6] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.falcon.io\/insights-hub\/topics\/social-media-strategy\/5-tips-instagram-advertising-campaigns\/\">https:\/\/www.falcon.io\/insights-hub\/topics\/social-media-strategy\/5-tips-instagram-advertising-campaigns\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>8% of US consumers admit that they buy fake designer brands and 5% lie to promote a product or brand.
