Even worse, appliance failure potentially can lead to electrical fires and&nbsp;deadly gas&nbsp;leaks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When making a purchase of white goods, consumers tend to rely on trusted brands and traditional supply chains &#8211; the complexity of these appliances makes it more difficult for infringers to fool consumers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The costs involved with manufacturing and distributing finished counterfeit appliances also creates a barrier to entry for bad actors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is replacement parts where the issue lies. Disreputable suppliers seek to fool cost-conscious consumers who search online for cheap replacement parts to extend the life of their white goods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fake replacement refrigerator parts such as water filters pose a danger to consumers, who rely on them to filter out contaminants &#8211; counterfeits are not up to this vital&nbsp;task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cOnline sales of counterfeit refrigerator water filters are a rapidly growing problem. These counterfeit water filters are sold with misleading and fraudulent labelling, often including illegal use of brand names, logos, and product labels,\u201d<\/em><\/p><cite>the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) warns in an online public awareness campaign(1).<br>&nbsp;<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The group\u2019s independent tests of counterfeit water filters purchased from websites demonstrate the alarming dangers that consumers face from a mistaken purchase:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201c[1] Counterfeit filters failed to remove harmful lead from household water.

The website listed four brands (Whirlpool, Samsung, Kenmore and GE) in its page title to deliberately cause consumer confusion and helped it to appear in search engine results when consumers searched for those brands.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All consumers arrived at this website via organic search. The top 5 keywords used to find the website were associated with genuine refrigerator water filter models: 69625-ct-001, aprilaire ffc20256sg, idylis es 12-id, ph21210 whir, and kohler k20852-na.35<sup>[2]<\/sup><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image no-styling\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"363\" height=\"214\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image.png 363w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image-300x177.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When conducting a search using these search terms on Google.com, \u2018refrigerator-water-filters.com\u2019 appeared on&nbsp;the first page of results in 4 out of 5 searches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refrigerator-water-filters.com offered a variety of counterfeit brand name and fake replacement water filters that were likely neither safe nor actually compatible with the refrigerators. For example, it offered a filter that it described as a \u201cWhirlpool EDR1RXD1\u201d and another that was described as a \u201cMaytag Puriclean III\u201d alongside pictures of packaging and product that contained brand name logos. The AHAM research suggests that these water filters did not meet consumer water filtration safety standards, potentially exposing unsuspecting consumers to contaminants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u2018About Us\u2019 section of the Refrigerator-water-filters.com website noted that the company was headquartered in China where \u201cproduction and product development takes place\u201d. From there, the products were shipped worldwide. Even though it claimed to produce and develop its own filters, it also falsely claimed that branded items were \u201coriginal\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image no-styling\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"425\" height=\"35\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6534\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image-1.png 425w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/image-1-300x25.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left heading-branded bg-grey--light\">Search Engines: Time to step up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Concern about consumer safety should extend beyond brands and industry groups, as fake replacement parts continue to pose a clear and present danger.
