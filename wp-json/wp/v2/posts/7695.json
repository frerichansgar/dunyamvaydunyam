Learn how Brand Protection can provide maximum value \u2013 protecting consumers and brands \u2013 with a strategic, refocused approach.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumer behavior is evolving rapidly, and we should anticipate an enduring shift of purchasing habits online. The increased time spent across all digital channels exposes consumers to increased risks \u2013 a level of risk that they would not be facing when visiting physical retail stores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fast heading towards a new normal<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u2018new normal\u2019, a phrase that is fast entering common parlance, is being used to describe social distancing measures and other behaviors that will likely be necessary for an extended period. But this phrase also applies to consumer buying habits and the future of e-commerce, with the pandemic likely to have a profound, permanent impact on where consumers decide to purchase the brands that they love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While tourism has seen a huge slump, the majority of sectors have seen online sales growth as displayed below. Consumers still require the vast majority of products that they purchased pre-COVID-19 \u2013 they are just pivoting to new channels to acquire them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"998\" height=\"406\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19.png\" alt=\"Heading towards the New Normal - Online sales growth during COVID-19\" class=\"wp-image-7705\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19.png 998w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19-300x122.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19-768x312.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The shift online will not replace offline spend across all sectors but represents a material change in consumers\u2019 expectations of brands. We would have expected e-commerce as a share of retail in the US to drop after the usual Q4 peak, but as seen in the graph below it has continued to grow after the Q4 2019 peak through Q1 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"560\" height=\"410\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Ecommerce-as-a-share-of-retail-2015-2019.png\" alt=\"Ecommerce as a share of retail 2015-2019\" class=\"wp-image-7706\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Ecommerce-as-a-share-of-retail-2015-2019.png 560w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Ecommerce-as-a-share-of-retail-2015-2019-300x220.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#009ca6;font-size:18px\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that these behaviors will continue, even when the coronavirus pandemic eventually subsides. Why? Because ecommerce habits tend to form during periods of intense activity, and those habits already have momentum, they come even stickier.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8211; Andrew Lipsman, eMarketer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad actors have reacted swiftly to the COVID-19 crisis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterfeiters and other bad actors are agile operators, reacting to the crisis by creating new products to meet increased demand, often as lookalike brands rather than direct counterfeits to avoid detection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talisman, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/difference\/talisman-online-brand-protection\/\">Incopro\u2019s Brand Protection platform<\/a>, discovered 20,000 units of counterfeit sanitizer sold on 1 Alibaba listing in a month, almost all sold to the US.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands otherwise unrelated to COVID-19 and hygiene are equally targeted by bad actors intending to capitalize on increased demand for hygiene goods, such as these fake face masks seen below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1014\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7711\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon.png 1014w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon-300x118.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon-768x303.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px\" \/><figcaption>Fake &#8216;branded&#8217; face masks seen on Amazon.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad actors have also increased supply of genuine critical medicines in line with news events and are selling at vastly inflated prices; supply has increased as the lockdown has endured. Incopro has monitored high-risk listings in the US for a painkiller brand between February and April. See the below graph that illustrates this disturbing trend in the US and maps it against key milestones during the crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"759\" height=\"376\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/High-risk-detections-in-USA-for-painkiller-brand.png\" alt=\"High risk detections in USA for painkiller brand\" class=\"wp-image-7720\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/High-risk-detections-in-USA-for-painkiller-brand.png 759w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/High-risk-detections-in-USA-for-painkiller-brand-300x149.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Price gouging has been rampant throughout the crisis, with standard packs of painkillers such as the brand monitored above sold for up to US$999.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, bad actors have adapted their behavior to avoid traditional detection techniques in the way they list products and the way they utilize digital channels. Businesses need to keep up if they are to protect their consumers and digital revenues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>All types of online brand abuse are on the rise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands are seeing \u2018traditional\u2019 types of online brand abuse increase, regardless of whether the product\u2019s design or description can be linked to COVID-19.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listings for non-genuine goods have increased for a wide range of products unrelated to hygiene as counterfeiters look to capitalize on increased online shopping. Since December 2019, for example, Incopro\u2019s Talisman software has detected:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A 94%&nbsp;increase in non-genuine listings of home appliance products &amp; spare parts since December 2019<\/li><li>A 51%&nbsp;increase in non-genuine listings of sporting goods and running shoes since December 2019<\/li><li>A 45%&nbsp;increase in non-genuine listings of high-end, luxury shoes since December 2019<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Consumer trust is under threat in the long term<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 29, Incopro polled 87 business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, asking about what they perceived to be the biggest risk to their businesses due to COVID-19 &#8211; over <strong>45%<\/strong> said the risk to consumer trust and the consumer to brand relationship. This highlights that they are recognizing the risk that the shift in market dynamic has created.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> Criminal activity that damages consumer trust online, such as phishing schemes and financial scams, is now being seen as a critical issue facing businesses. We are seeing businesses that would not traditionally face high volumes of online scams using their brand and IP now entering the crosshairs of online criminals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"864\" height=\"148\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7700\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams.png 864w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams-300x51.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams-768x132.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px\" \/><figcaption>Data sourced from Google\u2019s \u2018Transparency Report\u2019 tool and a report released by Barclays in April 2020.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take Morrisons, a leading UK grocery store, for example. During the initial stockpiling period of the crisis, Incopro analysts discovered a phishing scheme targeting Morrisons\u2019 customers that posed as an online competition to win unlimited groceries. The linked website asked consumers to enter their personal details and was connected to multiple social media pages and accounts, including a Facebook page. The latter accrued over&nbsp;<strong>5.9k<\/strong>&nbsp;followers before it was eventually removed by the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterfeiters have responded rapidly to increased demand for many categories and will react to future changes in consumer behavior. There has been a significant increase in all forms of brand abuse that threaten consumers\u2019 trust in brands \u2013 <a>businesses need to <\/a>maintain the valuable relationships they have built through omnichannel touchpoints over a long period of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Build the internal case for Brand Protection<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Those responsible for protecting consumers should take focus on <strong>three key actions<\/strong> that will support awareness and effectiveness in the current climate and beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"1\"><li><strong>Build internal coalition<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Build working groups including ecommerce, marketing &amp; security across function and ensure all relevant parties are engaged &amp; aligned<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Communicate to senior leadership<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Proactively report value &amp; risks to senior leadership around business outcomes: customer safety, revenue &amp; trust<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Articulate the full business value of brand protection<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where budgets are under pressure or increased investment is needed, it is critical that the full value of brand protection is understood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Strategic initiatives for your Brand Protection program<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the huge challenges facing all businesses &#8211; bricks &amp; mortar retail channels shutting down, workforces operating remotely, and the furloughing of staff \u2013 consumer trust in digital channels is critical to survival. There has never been a more important time to protect your brand and consumers online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same poll of business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, we asked whether their business had altered strategy in the face of changing consumer behavior \u2013 over <strong>85%<\/strong> said&nbsp;they had already made changes or were planning to, and only <strong>1%<\/strong> stated they did not plan to make any changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blueprint for Brand Protection success will vary by business and sector, but there are five key levers for actions you should be taking:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#009ca6\" class=\"has-text-color has-medium-font-size\"><strong>1. Align with key sales channels to capture online revenue<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Align Brand Protection strategies with ecommerce to focus on key products, territories &amp; platforms<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#009ca6\" class=\"has-text-color has-medium-font-size\"><strong>2. Prioritize in line with consumer behavior to protect trust<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus enforcement on what the consumer sees &amp; buys \u2013 prioritize to listing spots &amp; owning key social channels<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#009ca6\" class=\"has-text-color has-medium-font-size\"><strong>3. Re-allocate resources from offline to online<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leverage offline budgets to increase online focus. If not possible, consider pooling budgets with other functions<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#009ca6\" class=\"has-text-color has-medium-font-size\"><strong>4. Ensure that COVID-19 related threats are addressed as critical business issues<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reputational risk is significant &amp; these issues should be flagged to senior leadership and mitigated rapidly<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#009ca6\" class=\"has-text-color has-medium-font-size\"><strong>5.
