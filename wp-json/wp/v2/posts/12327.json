However, e-commerce events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday continue to be targeted by copycats, impersonators and counterfeiters who exploit spikes in consumer demand.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These sales figures should be understood as part of a trend; e-commerce growth continues at rapid pace, with brick-and-mortar footfall decimated by the ongoing effects of COVID-19. In 2020, e-commerce tore up previous predictions and grew by <strong>30%<\/strong> in the US[2]. This is a new high for online sales, and a level not previously predicted until 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this piece, we detail our findings on brand exploitation during Black Friday 2020 and illustrate why a comprehensive Brand Protection strategy is needed to ensure your business can succeed as the world rapidly shifts online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Brand exploiter behavior during Black Friday<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand exploiters hide their fake products among genuine discounted goods and are therefore able to mask low pricing that would usually raise eyebrows. Even to the savviest of consumers, counterfeits become difficult to identify within a sea of constantly changing offers and flash-sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <strong>55%<\/strong> of consumers begin their online shopping searches on Amazon\u2019s site [3] \u2013 brand owners are immediately put at a disadvantage by brand exploiters operating on marketplaces during sale events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Black Friday 2020: Rampant brand exploitation on large e-commerce platforms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The holidays are a particularly prolific time for brand exploiters. With 2020&#8217;s record-high online shopping volumes, counterfeit listings and sales are spiking. For example, in the week of Thanksgiving \/ run up to Black Friday \/ Cyber Monday 2020, compared to a week 3 months back, Incopro\u2019s technology detected:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>443%<\/strong> growth of high-risk listings on Amazon for a consumer electronics brand<\/li><li><strong>155%<\/strong> growth of high-risk listings on eBay for a watch\/jewelry retailer<\/li><li><strong>121%<\/strong> increase in high-risk listings on Amazon for a luxury brand<\/li><li><strong>51%<\/strong> increase in high-risk listings on Amazon for a streetwear brand<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Percentage growth of infringement on Amazon &amp; eBay in the run up to December<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<\/td><td>19th-26th August<\/td><td>19th-26th November<\/td><td>Growth<\/td><td>Platform<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Consumer electronics<\/td><td>228<\/td><td>1239<\/td><td>443%<\/td><td>Amazon<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Watch brand<\/td><td>442<\/td><td>1125<\/td><td>155%<\/td><td>Ebay<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Luxury brand<\/td><td>206<\/td><td>455<\/td><td>121%<\/td><td>Amazon<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Streetwear brand<\/td><td>360<\/td><td>543<\/td><td>51%<\/td><td>Amazon<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Why platforms need to do more<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many platforms have measures in place to facilitate the removal of brand exploiters. However, these tools offer varied results and do not provide enough coverage to make a lasting impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-amazon-brand-registry-not-providing-peace-of-mind-to-brands\">Amazon \u2013 Brand Registry not providing peace of mind to brands<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform\u2019s Brand Protection program \u201cBrand Registry\u201d is characterized by slow and inadequate responses to brand exploitation. Inconsistencies in the processing time for similar or identical violations also create a headache for brand owners. This means cases often need to be escalated \u2013 this additional step is burdensome and far more inconsistent than the initial reporting process.<br><br>Furthermore, Amazon often prevents brand owners from reporting violations if the rate of successful enforcement is deemed too low, and subsequently demand that a test purchase is conducted as evidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-ebay-inconsistent-responses-to-enforcement-and-declining-compliance\">eBay \u2013 Inconsistent responses to enforcement and declining compliance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>eBay too suffers from inconsistent and slow responses to enforcement. It has also recently shown a decline in overall compliance. Practices towards similar or identical reported listings vary enormously across territories. And to add further frustration, explanations for notice rejections are frequently inconsistent, incorrect, or missing altogether, requiring multiple follow-ups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such issues extend to notices regarding breaches of the platform\u2019s own policy, which covers soon-to-expire and expired products or products missing expiry dates, particularly in relation to medication, foodstuffs, and other consumable goods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-what-can-brands-do\">What can brands do?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is essential that brands monitor brand exploitation trends in the run-up to Black Friday. For each high-priority platform, you should have a comprehensive strategy in place. Our proposed strategy for Amazon during the holiday season is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Monitor the buy box on your listings closely (up to 82% of all Amazon sales go through the buy box [4])<\/li><li>Proactively defend your brand on Amazon by signing up to Brand Registry and \u2018gate\u2019 high-priority ASINs (the ASIN is the unique offer identifier on Amazon &#8211; it poses difficulty to brand owners because Amazon requires all listings for a single product to be located on the same ASIN page)<\/li><li>Monitor non-gated authorized ASINs and look for duplicates<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amazon\u2019s Brand Registry<\/strong>&nbsp;offers tools to help brands manage their presence on the marketplace and to remove infringing products, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bulk enforcement of counterfeit ASINs<\/li><li>Merging duplicate ASINs<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br>ASIN gating<\/strong>&nbsp;refers to the practice of \u2018locking\u2019 authorized ASINs so that only a select list of verified sellers can operate on it. Brands should be aware that it is only available to those enrolled in the Brand Registry. It is a paid service and is reserved for a select number of your listings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-a-comprehensive-year-round-strategy\">A comprehensive year-round strategy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, we mentioned that growth in e-commerce is not isolated to sales event but is part of a long-term trend that has been accelerated by COVID-19. In a post-pandemic world, you\u2019ll need a comprehensive strategy that protects your consumers and revenue streams online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noting the limitations of platforms tools, collaboration with platforms is still core to building this strategy. Where&nbsp;your consumers shop and&nbsp;who&nbsp;they purchase from are important considerations when choosing the platforms that you prioritize and develop robust relationships with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided the key platforms in which to focus your efforts, you should seek to engage with them directly or through a trusted partner. The following approach should be considered as part of your relationship building exercise:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts within the platforms\u2019 support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;<\/li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;<\/li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;and interact with the relevant representatives where the platform has local websites<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As alluded to, there is only so much you can achieve without a technology solution. A critical component of a comprehensive strategy is sophisticated&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectiontechnology\">Brand Protection technology<\/a>&nbsp;that works in tandem with platform tools but also:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Collects more data on the individuals exploiting your brand<\/li><li>Prioritizes high-risk listings that your consumers are most likely to find<\/li><li>Makes the connection between brand exploiters operating across multiple channels and regions<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Brand Protection technology is critical<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Talisman, Incopro\u2019s Brand Protection platform, is a complete tool that ensures that businesses have all the data they need related to brand exploitation, including the risk posed by infringing listings and a view of the networks of criminals targeting their brands.
