We are pleased to note that Google has made some progress by allowing brands to request that Google de-list individual infringing URLs \u2013 but we also remain clear that it has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/news\/googles-policy-change-on-search-results-selling-fakes-is-welcome-progress-but-company-urged-to-do-more\">not done enough<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The explosion in e-commerce via online marketplaces has revolutionized the way consumers engage with the brands they love \u2013 overwhelmingly for the good.

This is further to a submission that Incopro provided in 2018. The Consultation looked (broadly) at Internet platforms located outside of the European Union, their role in facilitating <g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">infringement<\/g> of intellectual property rights and related consumer harm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Consultation is aimed at procuring stakeholder input and seeks to refresh the original watchlist (published in December 2018) with a focus on on-line marketplaces located <strong>outside<\/strong> of the European Union reported to engage in or facilitate <g class=\"gr_ gr_25 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"25\" data-gr-id=\"25\">substantial<\/g> infringement of intellectual property rights (in particular those infringements concerning piracy and counterfeiting).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The focus of the Incopro submission was on online marketplaces considered to be \u2018non-compliant\u2019, being ones which typically feature:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul><li>slow response times\/inadequate response to notice sending;<\/li><li>unreasonable enforcement requirements; and<\/li><li>unwillingness to accept relevant IP rights.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>High Risk Platforms<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Incopro undertook analysis in order to understand which marketplace platforms located outside of the European Union are the most problematic for the 700+ global brands we work with across a broad range of sectors including luxury and fashion, technology, FMCG, pharmaceuticals <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">and<\/g> healthcare.&nbsp; The analysis involved looking at the behaviors and characteristics of platforms considered by these brands to be high risk. These were: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>volume of infringing listings;<\/li><li>enforcement requirements;<\/li><li>responsiveness to notice sending;<\/li><li>compliance; and<\/li><li>sanctions applied to repeat infringers<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>amongst others.&nbsp; The results are summarized below. Shading indicates that the platform was already brought to the Commission\u2019s attention through Incopro\u2019s original submission in 2018 and so continues to be deserving of scrutiny by the Commission.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-default\"><img width=\"1039\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/9-marketplaces-rationalised.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8780\" title=\"no-styling\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/9-marketplaces-rationalised.jpg 1039w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/9-marketplaces-rationalised-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/9-marketplaces-rationalised-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/9-marketplaces-rationalised-768x979.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Incopro supports enhanced regulation of online marketplaces through meaningful, legislative reform to address what is a matter of substantial public interest. &nbsp;The Commission is expected to publish the results of the Consultation towards the end of 2020; we look forward to sharing our analysis of those results in due course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">About Incopro<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re changing the face of Brand Protection by uniting businesses against a common enemy.
