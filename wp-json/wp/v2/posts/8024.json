The COVID-19 crisis is no different, with bad actors swift to list both medical products and everyday consumer items at marked-up prices as demand skyrockets.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Price gouging refers to the act of exploiting consumers during an external crisis by charging excessive prices for products far above the market rate. During the COVID-19 crisis, price gouging has been observed on B2C marketplaces and websites by distributors and private sellers. Many countries have anti-price gouging legislation to protect consumers during national emergencies, but even where protections do not exist platforms will often prohibit the practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, Amazon claimed it had removed more than half a million COVID-related items and suspended more than 6,000 sellers across its global marketplaces after infringing its price gouging rules[1].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an unusual step, Amazon has even gone as far as requesting new legislation to be drafted with VP of Public Policy Brian Huseman calling on Congress to make price gouging illegal during a national crisis[2]. The executive notes that similar laws already exist at state level and are effective at fighting bad actors online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID-19 crisis has seen a dramatic increase in price gouging on a wide range of products, including those that consumers are more reliant on than ever: pharmaceuticals, hygiene products, and medical equipment. This piece looks at the data, providing analysis of the scale of the issue, before sharing insights into how your business can tackle this growing threat effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Price gouging pharmaceuticals: Exploiting vulnerable consumers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 related price gouging was first identified on marketplace listings for pharmaceuticals and other medical equipment supplies. Globally, enforcement agencies and regional authorities are looking to demonstrate their vigilance to the public in this climate and are watching for price hikes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full no-styling\"><img width=\"620\" height=\"350\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Price-gouging-on-face-masks-listed-on-eBay-April-2020.png\" alt=\"Price gouging on face masks sold on eBay (April 2020)\" class=\"wp-image-8075\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Price-gouging-on-face-masks-listed-on-eBay-April-2020.png 620w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Price-gouging-on-face-masks-listed-on-eBay-April-2020-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><figcaption>Price gouging on face masks sold on eBay (April 2020)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full no-styling\"><img width=\"620\" height=\"350\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Price-gouging-on-branded-hand-sanitizer-sold-on-e-commerce-website-April-2020.png\" alt=\"Price gouging on branded hand sanitizer sold on e-commerce website (April 2020)\" class=\"wp-image-8070\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Price-gouging-on-branded-hand-sanitizer-sold-on-e-commerce-website-April-2020.png 620w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Price-gouging-on-branded-hand-sanitizer-sold-on-e-commerce-website-April-2020-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><figcaption>Price gouging on branded hand sanitizer sold on e-commerce website (April 2020)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Talisman, Incopro\u2019s Brand Protection platform, has identified rampant price gouging in recent weeks &#8211; which were then acted on by our analysts. These are just two of the countless infringing listings discovered:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Price gouging of up to a staggering <strong>750%<\/strong> for a well-known painkiller with a box of 24 capsules on eBay for <strong>$329<\/strong> with no guarantee they are authentic.<\/li><li>Price gouging of up to <strong>100%<\/strong> for a global cold &amp; flu brand across key marketplaces around the world.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Price gougers are exploiting vulnerable consumers who feel that they have little choice but to pay the hugely inflated prices for essential medical drugs and supplies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Price gouging on consumer goods: Taking advantage of spikes in demand<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue is not isolated to the health sector; we have also observed an increase in price gouging across a wide range of other product categories. Incopro\u2019s Brand Protection experts harnessed Talisman to monitor these product categories on Amazon US for price gouging:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Desks and computer monitors<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>desks<\/strong> and <strong>computer monitors<\/strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings on average by <strong>193%<\/strong> since COIVD-19 hit. An example can be seen below, showing the increase in price listed by a third-party seller for a desk from the beginning of the year to now, clearly taking advantage of the crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One listing for a simple home-working desk saw a large price increase of <strong>247%<\/strong>, going from <strong>$89<\/strong> to <strong>$220<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"476\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020.jpg\" alt=\"Price fluctuations on home office furniture sold on Amazon.com (May 2020)\" class=\"wp-image-8072\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020-300x143.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020-768x366.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><figcaption>Price fluctuations on home office furniture sold on Amazon.com (May 2020)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Sports and exercise equipment<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>bench presses<\/strong> and <strong>yoga mats<\/strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings by <strong>168%<\/strong> on average since COVID-19 hit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One listing saw a large price increase of <strong>370%<\/strong>, going from <strong>$160<\/strong> to <strong>$330<\/strong>.

Distributors of the products will not face the brunt of your reputational damage, even if they are the party engaging in price gouging. Any damage is likely to be long-term and extremely difficult to repair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, Incopro polled 87 business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, asking about what they perceived to be the biggest risk to their businesses due to COVID-19 \u2013 over&nbsp;<strong>45%<\/strong>&nbsp;said the risk to consumer trust and the consumer-to-brand relationship. This highlights that they recognize the risk that the shift in market dynamic has created.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Platforms cannot tackle the threat alone<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve noted that some platforms are taking action, and governments are setting up dedicated &#8216;price gouging&#8217; taskforces &#8211; but they are unable to stem the tide alone. Amazon, for example, will actively monitor for price gouging, but due to the scale of the problem and the limits of their technology may be slow to identity and remove infringements. However, if they are notified by a brand of specific instances of price gouging, they will be able to act far swifter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incopro\u2019s Brand Protection technology and expert analysts give you cross-platform, cross-territory insights into price gouging with a tried and tested online enforcement solution delivered at scale directly from the platform. The platform can also collate evidence packs for injunctions and wider monetary relief. and bespoke reporting by brand, platform, territory provides internal stakeholders with valuable sales insights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Price gouging is not a new phenomenon \u2013 it existed before COVID-19 and will continue even as the global crisis eventually subsides. By taking a strong stance now, you can put consumer safety at the heart of your Brand Protection strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our price gouging solution can be delivered alongside your existing Brand Protection strategy, with a fast spin up.
