Most hosting platforms, therefore, take action quickly to remove such listings.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p> By contrast, search engines are not typically understood to be hosting platforms. They have typically taken the view that they do not need to take any action when they are told about a trademark infringing website indexed in their search results. Rights owners can notify search engines of counterfeit listings in their indices but no action will be taken. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Google is on record in this regard. In recent correspondence with Incopro, it said:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cGoogle does not at this time de-index URLs or websites from its Web Search index on trademark grounds upon request\u201d.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-primary--light\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center heading-branded\" id=\"h-incopro-s-recommendations-for-a-new-approach\"> Incopro&#8217;s recommendations for a new approach <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"h-scalable-court-sanctioned-approach\">Scalable court-sanctioned approach<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, a scalable court-sanctioned approach is undermined by the search engines. They will not remove indexed search results when they have been notified that these link to a counterfeit product or website. Instead, they require the rights holder to bring legal action against the counterfeit website to secure an order that covers index removal order. This process is slow, costly and is not scalable for the vast number of brands and consumers affected. Search engines actively oppose applications for orders that are more scalable and that focus on requiring Google to act directly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many jurisdictions, case law is developing that may ultimately present a liability challenge to search engines. If the law starts to hold search engines liable for damages where they knowingly point to counterfeit selling websites, they will have no choice but to act.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"h-established-legal-precedent\">Established legal precedent<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a well established legal principle that applies to all internet platforms, including search engines, that could require Google to act even if it is not liable. We suggest search engines should embrace this principle and work with rights owners to demonstrate their willingness to act. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"159\" height=\"147\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/legal-action.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-663\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p> Already, a series of precedent-setting cases in Canada, the United Kingdom, and France have established that the courts are able to require search engines to remove a website or counterfeit listing regardless of their direct liability. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-white\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left heading-branded\" id=\"h-time-for-google-to-step-up\"> Time for Google to step up <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Google shows no sign of reforming its practices. In a recent letter to Incopro, the search engine promised only \u201cto evaluate court orders issued against third parties\u201d. It warned it would continue to \u201cseek relief from orders against it\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe it is time for search engines to change their mindset and to work with rights holders for the benefit of the online consumer. This would mean building processes that embrace the emerging legal basis that exists for securing delisting remedies from the courts \u2013 ensuring that the process for tackling counterfeits and other infringements of is scalable and effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"505\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Search-Engines_white-paper_thumb.png\" alt=\"Incopro -
