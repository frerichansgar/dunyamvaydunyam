While it is still important for consumers that brands provide a true representation of themselves, a quarter (25%) don\u2019t think it is important that online influencers\/ celebrities provide a representation. Interestingly this drops to 17% in the 18-24 age group, reflecting the demographic more likely to be influenced by celebrity culture.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<p class=\"has-very-light-gray-color has-text-color\">While most consumers (61%) said they would not be willing to engage in fake behaviors to impress their friends online, 8% confirmed they have bought fake designer brands in order to look good and 5% have knowingly lied to promote a product or brand. This intentional misrepresentation has a hugely damaging impact and further underlines the challenges facing brands in retaining control over consumer perception<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2476\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-1536x1536.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-2048x2048.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left heading-branded\" id=\"h-where-is-the-risk\">Where is the Risk? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the phrase \u2018fake news\u2019 is used daily, it is interesting to discover what consumers are more concerned about. Fake news is, of course, a huge concern for society today, but looking at the results, only&nbsp;<strong>20%<\/strong>&nbsp;cite fake news as the biggest threat to society \u2013 far behind fake pharmaceuticals (<strong>34%<\/strong>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are several dangerous fake goods that consumers appear to have overlooked. Just&nbsp;<strong>6%<\/strong>&nbsp;cite fake cosmetics as a big threat \u2013 yet cosmetics and pharmaceutical products made up 6.5% of all counterfeit good seizures in the U.S. in 2017, estimated to be worth $69 million. Seized goods have been found to contain toxic materials such as cyanide, arsenic, lead, mercury and, in some cases, even rat excrement. These harmful ingredients will cause skin irritation, rash or infection, and many are linked to a higher risk of cancer.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"321\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Pharmaceuticals-infographic_34.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2488\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Pharmaceuticals-infographic_34.png 500w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Pharmaceuticals-infographic_34-300x193.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-primary\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"338\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Marketplace-Icon_Negative_RGB.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5436\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left heading-branded has-very-light-gray-color has-text-color\" id=\"h-marketplaces-need-to-step-up\">Marketplaces need to step up <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-very-light-gray-color has-text-color\">People are trying to protect themselves from fake goods, fake news, fake society.
