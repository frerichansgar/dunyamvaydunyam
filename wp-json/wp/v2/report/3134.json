Just under a fifth&nbsp;<strong>(19%)<\/strong>&nbsp;of people have intentionally opted for a counterfeit item and, of these,&nbsp;<strong>(37%)<\/strong>&nbsp;have bought more than three items in the past 12 months alone. Indeed, as fakes become more endemic, consumer attitudes and behaviour appear to be changing, with almost a third (31%) of consumers considering buying fake clothing, leather goods (28%), footwear (27%) and watches (26%).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-primary\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-who-do-you-trust\">Who do you trust? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-loss-of-trust-is-not-limited-to-the-brands-almost-two-thirds-65-of-consumers-will-lose-trust-in-a-marketplace-after-buying-fake-goods-just-under-half-49-in-search-engines\">The loss of trust is not limited to the brands \u2013 almost two thirds (<strong>65%<\/strong>) of consumers will lose trust in a marketplace after buying fake goods, just under half (<strong>49%<\/strong>) in search engines.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet just as consumers appear willing to buy fakes, their attitudes to and expectations of trust appears to be a fast-changing concept. While in the main it is still important for consumers that brands provide a true representation of themselves, almost a quarter (<strong>24%<\/strong>) don\u2019t think it is important that online influencers\/ celebrities provide a true representation. Interestingly this drops to 13% in the 18-24 age group, reflecting the demographic more likely to be influenced by celebrity culture.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div style=\"height:120px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p> Consumers\u2019 own fake behaviour online is also on the rise \u2013 and has a direct impact on brand values and image. While most UK consumers (<strong>68%<\/strong>) do not engage in fake behaviours to impress their friends, 6% confirm they buy fake designer brands to look good and 5% knowingly lie to promote a product or brand. This intentional misrepresentation has a hugely damaging impact and further underlines the challenges facing brands in retaining control over consumer perception and the quality of digital experience. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2476\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-1536x1536.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Incopro-Graphic-Asset_influencer-2048x2048.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-where-is-the-risk\">Where is the Risk? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From voting behaviour onwards, the public\u2019s awareness of fake news \u2013 and its impact \u2013 has been transformed over the past few years. Yet UK consumers are far more concerned about fake pharmaceuticals (<strong>44%<\/strong>) than fake news (<strong>13%<\/strong>).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are several dangerous fake goods that consumers appear to have overlooked. Just<strong>&nbsp;7%<\/strong>&nbsp;cite fake cosmetics as big threat \u2013 yet products have been found to contain toxic materials such as cyanide, arsenic, lead, mercury and, in some cases, even rat excrement. These harmful ingredients will cause skin irritation, rash or infection, and many are linked to a higher risk of cancer.<br>Just&nbsp;<strong>7%<\/strong>&nbsp;cite fake car parts \u2013 yet the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) estimates that more than \u20ac2 billion is lost each year due to counterfeit tires and batteries being sold and offered for sale inside the EU. Counterfeit airbags, brake pads, seatbelts and tires do not adhere to stringent safety regulations and increase the risk of serious injury or death if the vehicle outfitted with them is involved in an accident.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As&nbsp;<strong>15%<\/strong>&nbsp;said they would consider buying fake car parts, clearly the risk associated with this category is something that consumers need to better understand.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"321\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Pharmaceuticals-infographic.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2486\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Pharmaceuticals-infographic.png 500w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Pharmaceuticals-infographic-300x193.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-primary\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"338\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Marketplace-Icon_Negative_RGB.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5436\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-marketplaces-need-to-step-up\">Marketplaces need to step up <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People are trying to protect themselves from fake goods, fake news, fake society.
