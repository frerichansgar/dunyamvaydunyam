There are many metrics online brand protection vendors use to demonstrate ROI to their clients: for instance, the number of enforcements carried out. At Incopro we work with clients to identify those most useful to their business, but we typically focus on the metrics we think are most meaningful:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The percentage reduction in infringements<\/li><li>The compliance rate of our enforcement<\/li><li>The number of sellers and users banned<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all quantifiable results that can be used to gauge success. However, it can be hard to translate this to quantify the financial benefits that our services deliver to our clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-four-key-areas-where-we-see-our-products-and-services-delivering-the-biggest-impact-for-our-clients-are\">The four key areas where we see our products and services delivering the biggest impact for our clients are:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1. Reducing lost sales and growing revenue<\/li><li>2. Helping stop brand dilution and loss of exclusivity<\/li><li>3. Protecting your brand from reputational harm<\/li><li>4. Reducing reputational risk and safety concerns arising from poor quality counterfeits<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, in order to achieve these outcomes at all, it\u2019s necessary to deliver a lasting reduction in online infringements. Unless enforcement activity is delivering this reduction, then even sending vast volumes of enforcement notices is unlikely to deliver positive business impacts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst these can\u2019t all have quantitative numbers against them, to measure the financial impact of our work Incopro recently commissioned the consultancy&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.oxera.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Oxera<\/a>&nbsp;to undertake an independent assessment on the financial benefit we have provided for one of our largest clients. The client is a global player in the luxury goods industry, with a number of the most recognizable brands in the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-the-study-shows\">What the study shows<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The study attempted to understand the incremental sales generated for our client through our work strategically enforcing against infringing social media users. In order to try to isolate the impact of our enforcement, the scope of the study was limited to a single brand in the Middle East, where social media infringement represents one of the largest online threats to brands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oxera used regression analysis to study the relationship using our enforcement data and the client\u2019s sales data in that region. A number of different models were considered alongside different lag periods between enforcement and sales impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-key-takeaway-social-media-enforcement-delivers-incremental-sales\">The key takeaway: social media enforcement delivers incremental sales<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Oxera\u2019s analysis found a clear link between our social media enforcement and increased genuine sales for our clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1. The correlation between enforcement action and sales &#8211; <strong>The study showed that for every infringing social media account taken down it equated to approximately 0.7-0.8 additional sales<\/strong>, and for 2017 this generated a significant amount in additional revenue for our client -and represented a massive return on investment. Whilst it\u2019s important to acknowledge that this type of analysis can never provide complete certainty, Oxera found a consistently positive relationship across all of its analyses supporting the conclusion that our work had driven incremental sales.<\/li><li>2. \u2018The lag effect\u2019 &#8211; The financial impact of Incopro\u2019s enforcement was felt in terms of\u00a0<strong>increased genuine sales within 1-2 weeks, although the full effect is seen after 3-4 weeks<\/strong>. This insight can have broader implications for brands; for instance, increasing emphasis on enforcement to clear the online space in the weeks ahead of a new product launch, or around major sales events such as Black Friday.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The results of this robust, independent research demonstrate that Incopro\u2019s intelligence-led, strategic approach to online brand protection really can deliver financial benefits to customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to learn how we can protect your brand and deliver an increase in sales on your online channels, please talk to one of our experts today.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"cta-button align-left\">\n    <a href=\"\/expert\" title=\"Talk&#x20;to&#x20;an&#x20;expert\"  class=\"btn btn--primary caret-btn\">Talk to an expert<\/a>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n<section class=\"latest-reports\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n                <h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Related reports<\/h2>\n                        <div class=\"reports\">\n                                        <article>\n                    <div class=\"article-preview\">\n                        <h3>Online Brand Protection Maturity Report: The 4 stages to maximizing your brand\u2019s strategic potential<\/h3>\n                        <p>Our Online Brand Protection Maturity Report outlines how to evolve your approach, secure further investment, and continue to support wider business growth.<\/p>\n                        <a href=\"\/reports\/online-brand-protection-maturity\/\" title=\"Online&#x20;Brand&#x20;Protection&#x20;Maturity&#x20;Report&#x3A;&#x20;The&#x20;4&#x20;stages&#x20;to&#x20;maximizing&#x20;your&#x20;brand&#x2019;s&#x20;strategic&#x20;potential\" class=\"btn btn--primary\">Read more<\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                <\/article>\n                            <article>\n                    <div class=\"article-preview\">\n                        <h3>Scams, Fakes &#038; Brand Abuse in FMCG: How to Protect Consumers &#038; Stay Ahead of Threats<\/h3>\n                        <p>This ebook explores the challenges facing the FMCG industry following the rise in e-commerce, and outlines the strategies brands are adopting to tackle fake products and other threats.<\/p>\n                        <a href=\"\/reports\/fakes-fmcg-protect-consumers-ebook\/\" title=\"Scams,&#x20;Fakes&#x20;&amp;&#x23;038&#x3B;&#x20;Brand&#x20;Abuse&#x20;in&#x20;FMCG&#x3A;&#x20;How&#x20;to&#x20;Protect&#x20;Consumers&#x20;&amp;&#x23;038&#x3B;&#x20;Stay&#x20;Ahead&#x20;of&#x20;Threats\" class=\"btn btn--primary\">Read more<\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                <\/article>\n                            <article>\n                    <div class=\"article-preview\">\n                        <h3>Counterfeit pharma: a growing online threat &#038; how to protect consumers<\/h3>\n                        <p>As counterfeit and harmful medical products infiltrate global markets at alarming rates, we\u2019re working with brands to tackle this problem and keep consumers safe.
