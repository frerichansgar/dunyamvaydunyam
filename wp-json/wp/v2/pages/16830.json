However, if search engines were to introduce a simplified de-indexing process to deal with trademark infringement, brands would be able to act faster to protect consumers and their online reputations, especially in scenarios where registrars or registrants are noncompliant.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn 2020, pressure from brand owners, trade associations, and Incopro led to a shift in Google&#8217;s stance, with the search engine giant launching a de-indexing tool for trademark infringements. This tool represents progress but does not yet go far enough in tackling entire websites dedicated to infringement. Hear from experts at Daniel Wellington, Wiggin, and Incopro on what the change means for brands and why a scalable solution is still needed.<\/p>\n                                                <a href=\"\/website-enforcement-why-google-must-go-further-in-tackling-counterfeits\/\" title=\"Read&#x20;more\"  class=\"btn btn--primary\">Read more<\/a>\n                                            <\/div>\n                                        <div>\n                        <img\n                            src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/search-engine-research.svg\"\n                            data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/search-engine-research.svg\"\n                            class=\"lazyload blur-up\"\n                            alt=\"\" \/>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    \n                <\/div>\n                                <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"brand-protection-technology\" class=\"wp-block-group bg-grey--light\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\" id=\"h-brand-protection-technology-part-of-the-puzzle\">Brand protection technology part of the puzzle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All brands have a shared goal of reducing online infringement and desire a simple, swift, and well-managed process for tackling bad actors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schemes such as Amazon Project Zero, eBay VeRO, and the WeChat Brand Protection Tool have enhanced the enforcement process for brands on these high-priority platforms. However, platform tools are only one piece of the puzzle and are not found on every marketplace or social media site.

Many of our customers are also part of brand collaborations such as the Alibaba Anti-Counterfeiting Alliance, enabling us to have influence over platform policies.
