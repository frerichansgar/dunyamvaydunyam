Please keep us informed if your Personal Data changes during your engagement with us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your rights in connection with Personal Data<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Personal Data is protected under the GDPR, CCPA or other similar data protection laws, under certain circumstances, you may have the right to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d). This enables you to request a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are processing it lawfully.<\/li><li>Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.<\/li><li>Request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.<\/li><li>Object to the processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and, other than for the purposes of direct marketing, there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.<\/li><li>Withdraw your consent from our use your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. This enables you to opt-out from any direct marketing communications, at any time. You have the right to opt (i) not to register to receive our electronic newsletters; and not to be contacted by telephone, direct mail or email.<\/li><li>Opt-out of the sale of your Personal Data. Since we do not sell your Personal Data, you are already opted-out of such sales.<\/li><li>Request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.<\/li><li>Request the transfer of your Personal Data to another party. This right will only apply in limited circumstances, where we process your Personal Data based on your consent or where the processing of Personal Data is necessary for the performance of a contract between us.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where applicable, to exercise any of these rights, please&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/corsearch.com\/en-US\/Privacy#Contact_Us\"><strong>contact us<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rights described herein are not absolute and we reserve all of our rights available to us under applicable law in this regard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not discriminate against you, for example, by charging you a different price or offering a different level of service, for exercising any of these rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your competent Data Protection Supervisory Authority. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a supervisory authority, so please&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/corsearch.com\/en-US\/Privacy#Contact_Us\"><strong>contact us<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;in the first instance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No fee usually required<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights above, where applicable). However, in accordance with the GDPR and other similar data protection laws, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What we may need from you<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights) and, in some instances, provide a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the individual whose personal information is the subject of the request. If it is necessary to collect additional information from you, we will use the information only for verification purposes and will delete it as soon as practicable after complying with the request. For requests related to particularly sensitive information, we may require additional proof of identification. This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you make a request through an authorized agent, we will require written proof that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time to respond<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.
