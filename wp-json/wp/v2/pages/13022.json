Searching online. Honing in on the product they want. Cruising through the perfect, frictionless buying experience you always wanted them to have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it happens. They come across that fake site or seller and they\u2019re presented with a temptingly cheap knock off. Or even more disconcertingly \u2013 a highly convincing fake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever their reaction is, it\u2019s one you\u2019re not going to want. Brand infringement is a trigger for a variety of undesirable consumer emotions that are going to impact your profits, your reputation &#8211; or both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it doesn\u2019t matter who you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re selling luxury goods, electronics, food or any other industry, you don\u2019t want your brand to be anywhere near this tawdry, reputation-damaging fakery that\u2019s diluting the strength of your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re selling goods at a low price point, it\u2019s still going to hit your sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\u2019s not just fakes you have to worry about. There\u2019s a whole world of other issues to consider; from regulatory breaches to social media impersonators, to phishing scams that could create headlines for all the wrong reasons.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-primary--light\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center heading-branded\" id=\"h-what-is-brand-protection\">What is Brand Protection?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"h-in-the-simplest-possible-terms-brand-protection-is-the-act-of-prevention-against-brand-infringement\">In the simplest possible terms Brand Protection is the act of prevention against brand infringement.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So by engaging in Brand Protection, you are seeking to prevent someone from infringing your brand illegally by using your intellectual property and\/or brand name. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what is the \u2018intellectual property\u2019 we talk of \u2013 and is it really all that intellectual? Well no, not necessarily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intellectual property is simply the legal framework that covers anything you produce that is a \u2018creation of the mind\u2019 \u2013 which could be an invention, artistic work, or product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your intellectual property could be a thousand-page novel or a new type of plug for a sink. Or it could simply be the logos you use to represent your brands. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image no-styling clear-top clear-bottom\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail\"><img width=\"145\" height=\"169\" src=\"https:\/\/mk0incoprorqrlirgki5.kinstacdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Brand-Protection-Icon_negative_RGB.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5714\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The intellectual property \u2018rights\u2019 that guard your assets are the same as the rights you have over any other kind of property. They allow you to benefit from your own work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds simple, doesn\u2019t it? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, no it isn\u2019t. Brand Protection isn\u2019t as easy as simply knowing your rights, because there are just so many ways that your brand can come under attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So before we move on to the various ways you can protect your brand and intellectual property, it will pay to take a few moments to consider some of the many ways that infringements can happen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-grey--light\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center heading-branded\" id=\"h-types-of-brand-infringement\">Types of Brand Infringement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h4 id=\"h-counterfeiting\">Counterfeiting<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterfeiting should need little introduction. It is the manufacturing or distribution of goods under your brand name or IP rights, without your permission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet there are subtle differences within the counterfeit trade that are important to define. Many counterfeiters produce knock-offs (non-identical imitation goods that do not feature branding or trademarks), for example, which are often very low quality and do not meet the criteria of what you might consider being a \u2018true\u2019 counterfeit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>True counterfeits, on the other hand, tend to be made at scale by criminal organizations. These criminal organizations often have access to materials that make their imitations very hard to differentiate from the genuine thing. They also tend to have wide distribution networks. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>True counterfeiting is a much more problematic area because it makes it much more difficult for you and your consumers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/how-to-spot-counterfeit-goods\/\"><strong>to see what is real and what is fake<\/strong>.<\/a> It can also pose serious health and safety risks. Counterfeit bike helmets, for example, have been known to shatter at the slightest impact when made from inferior materials and without adherence to required industry standards. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:24px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image no-styling clear-top clear-bottom\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"223\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/counterfeiting-icon.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3234\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-primary--light\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 id=\"h-there-are-many-other-types-of-infringement-you-need-to-consider\">There are many other types of infringement you need to consider.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-copyright-infringement\">Copyright infringement<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Copyright infringement refers to the unauthorized copying, distribution, display or performance of any of your works protected by copyright. Copyright is a core type of intellectual property covering original works such as literary, video, photographic, audio or other art forms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-trademark-infringement\">Trademark infringement<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Trademark infringement, on the other hand, is the unauthorized use of your trademark on goods and services. Trademarks are a badge of origin and anything that can be used to differentiate your products or services from others often falls within this. Trademarks usually take the form of words, logos, patterns, and shapes associated with your brand. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-patent-theft-or-patent-infringement\">Patent theft or patent infringement<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there is patent theft or patent infringement \u2013 the act of making or selling your patented product without your permission. A patent is an exclusive right that can be granted to you by government authorities for a new invention \u2013 i.e. a product or process that is original or provides a new solution to a problem.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image no-styling clear-top clear-bottom\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"243\" height=\"243\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/infringement-types-icon.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3235\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-design-infringement\">Design infringement<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Design infringement is similar to patent infringement and usually involves the manufacture of goods using patented design features to create a similar unauthorized version of your product. According to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/758496\/Design-Rights-Infringement-report-2018.pdf\">a report by the UK government Intellectual Property Office<\/a><\/strong>, a staggering 98.3% of design rights owners say they have experience of design infringement. It is a particular problem in the fashion industry, where so-called fast fashion outlets often produce lookalikes of new range launches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you enter the world of Brand Protection, you\u2019re also likely to hear the term intellectual property infringement. This is the umbrella term that covers all types of IP infringement, including copyright and trademark infringement. Intellectual property infringement also covers infringement of your design patents or theft of your trade secrets. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 id=\"h-we-also-need-to-mention-the-various-tactics-and-mechanisms-by-which-the-act-of-brand-infringement-is-carried-out\">We also need to mention the various tactics and mechanisms by which the act of brand infringement is carried out.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-rogue-or-copycat-websites\">Rogue or copycat websites<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Rogue or copycat websites, for example, are set up to imitate the official site of your brand, often with a subtly subverted version of your official URL. Other types of rogue websites do not necessarily attempt to replicate the look and feel of the official site. They look and feel like fakes. But the purpose is the same \u2013 to sell counterfeit products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-phishing\">Phishing<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A related practice, phishing, is the act of impersonating your brand in order to gather personal details. These details are often gathered via order and contact forms on rogue websites. Once gathered, the details can be used to carry out theft, identity theft, and online fraud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-social-media-impersonation\">Social media impersonation<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media impersonation, meanwhile, is an increasingly common practice that involves creating fake social media accounts under the guise of your official brand \u2013 often with the intention of redirecting consumers to rogue websites or listings on e-commerce platforms that sell counterfeit or infringing goods. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image clear-top clear-bottom no-styling\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"305\" height=\"199\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/fraud-icon.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3236\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-fraud\">Fraud<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A word also about fraud and the terminology that surrounds it. In Brand Protection terms, fraud usually refers to the sale of goods by sellers misrepresenting their authorized status or the products and offers they provide. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fraud is often carried out via <strong>false association<\/strong>, which is the creation of the appearance of a relationship that may be illegitimate or fraudulent, but where there may be a relationship of some kind in existence. More serious cases of fraud by false association fall under the category of <strong>unauthorized use<\/strong>, which is the creation of a relationship where none previously existed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-compliance\">Compliance<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we also need to mention that Brand Protection also extends to the issue of compliance. This is used by brands to ensure that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/blog\/beyond-anti-counterfeiting-a-look-into-incopros-special-projects-team\"><strong>official resellers comply with industry standards<\/strong>.<\/a> Compliance is particularly important if you operate in a highly regulated industry such as pharmaceuticals, where the sale goods are strictly controlled by the government and independent regulators.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-primary--light\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center heading-branded\" id=\"h-why-do-i-need-brand-protection\">Why do I need Brand Protection?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>We don\u2019t really need to tell you. Ignoring these threats is not going to be a good idea \u2013 online platforms are unlikely to fight in your corner without your support and, left to their own devices, will <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/blog\/how-ecommerce-platforms-facilitate-online-counterfeiting\">exacerbate the problem.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re going to lose money. Your reputation is going to suffer. People are going to outright steal your ideas and come back and do it again. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do you even begin to quantify what that really means for your business \u2013 in real terms? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s plenty of research out there that will help you build your business case. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/living-in-a-fake-society-us\"><strong>a recent study by Sapio Research<\/strong><\/a>, for example, 52% of US consumers say they have lost trust in a brand after unintentionally purchasing counterfeit products online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a huge potential hit to your brand. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further Sapio research says that this lack of trust has a direct effect on buying behavior. A separate survey found that as many as 76% of consumers are less likely to buy products from a brand that is regularly associated with counterfeit goods.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>The European Economic and Social Committee says that the probable overall value of trade in counterfeit products worldwide is likely to be between EUR 600 billion (UN) and close to EUR 1 trillion. A recent <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/newsroom\/trade-in-fake-goods-is-now-33-of-world-trade-and-rising.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development<\/a><\/strong> (OECD), meanwhile, says that the value of imported fake goods worldwide currently stands at over $500 billion annually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:24px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image clear-top no-styling\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"437\" height=\"172\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/fake-news-statistic.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3237\"\/><figcaption>Source: OECD and EU Intellectual Property Office, 2019<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:24px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, the impact of counterfeit goods on brand value, buying habits and even wider societies and national economies is huge.<br> If you want to know more about the wider economic impact of counterfeiting, you can find out more in the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/reports\/living-in-a-fake-society-us\">full Sapio report.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:24px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center heading-branded\" id=\"h-brand-protection-strategy\">Brand Protection Strategy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">So enough about the challenges. What about solutions? Before you even think about the technology you are going to need, your response needs to start with a well-thought-out strategy. But what exactly should that strategy include?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h4 id=\"h-ip-portfolio\">IP portfolio<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, if you don\u2019t already have the expertise in-house, you need to get some good IP portfolio advice that will help you to manage and protect your IP portfolio effectively. This might include performing clearance searches to screen new brands or dealing with trademark and design registration to secure your brand in all key markets. Bottom line: you will need to manage your intellectual property by ensuring it\u2019s fully protected against any possible local objections to maximize its potential monetary value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-business-intelligence\">Business intelligence<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, you will need to set up a mechanism for data collection and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/blog\/online-brand-protection-enhanced-business-intelligence-and-market-opportunities\"><strong>gathering business intelligence.<\/strong><\/a> This will also need to work across many e-commerce platforms and geographies. How much do you know about where your brand is being infringed online? Which products are most affected? In which regions? And where is the most traffic going? Gathering this kind of intelligence should be the cornerstone of your Brand Protection strategy and will help you to prioritize effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-prioritization-and-threat-analysis\">Prioritization and threat analysis<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With this kind of information and intelligence at your disposal, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019re also going to feel a little overwhelmed. This means your strategy is also going to need a level of prioritization and threat analysis that will help you manage and target your IP protection and anti-piracy\/anti-counterfeiting efforts effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-ip-enforcement\">IP enforcement<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, you will need to think about IP enforcement. On the simplest level, this will mean putting a mechanism in place to notify online marketplaces when you have identified an infringement by someone selling on their platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, you will also need to have a tried and tested means of contacting infringing parties directly. Not all infringers are necessarily criminals, some may even be ardent fans of your brand. They may just be failing to comply with your brand guidelines when reselling products. So it also pays to have a \u2018friendly\u2019 way to contact these sellers and keep them in line.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image clear-top clear-bottom no-styling\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"468\" height=\"440\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/brand-protection-strategy.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3239\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-online-advertising-monitoring\">Online advertising monitoring<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of this strategy, it may be relevant for your brand to carry out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/difference\/talisman-online-brand-protection\/\"><strong>extensive online advertising monitoring<\/strong>.<\/a> This will help you identify where your ads are shown in undesirable locations and deliver the intelligence you need to rectify it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-social-media-monitoring\">Social media monitoring<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media monitoring is equally important. This is because it often reveals networks of bad sellers that spread their influence through popular social media channels. Recently, a case was recorded where the discovery of a single Instagram account promoting counterfeit goods led to the exposure of a network of 531 social media accounts. This network had a combined total of 716,645 followers, 14,143 infringing URLs and 7,138 infringing listings on online marketplaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-network-of-partners\">Network of partners<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to pursue your anti-counterfeiting strategy to the fullest possible extent, you will also need to put in place <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/difference\/partnerships\/\">a network of \u2018offline\u2019 partners<\/a><\/strong> (such as law enforcement or government customs agencies) that you work with to chase down the most persistent offenders.<br> For some brands, though not all, this course of action is likely to lead you towards IP enforcement and Brand Protection litigation. This will often be the final piece in the Brand Protection strategy for those brands who pursue it.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-grey--light\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center heading-branded\" id=\"h-brand-protection-solutions\">Brand Protection Solutions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:24px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>You\u2019re building an understanding of what Brand Protection is going to do for your business.
