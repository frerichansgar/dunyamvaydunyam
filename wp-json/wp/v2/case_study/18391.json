It started more or less instantaneously \u2013 we&#8217;d not had a problem one day, and then the next week we had a huge problem on websites and marketplaces.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3>Social media advertising<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Online infringement has now expanded into social media, with counterfeiters using adverts to direct unsuspecting consumers to their websites, Tom says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe focus on blocking infringers\u2019 advertising on social media because that&#8217;s possible in a relatively short period of time, whereas it can be difficult to get a website taken down without legal action, which costs money and time.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center heading-branded\">Sophisticated counterfeits and the threat to brand reputation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>\u201cA lot of the techniques that have become industry standard over the last 20 years are those we invented. And so, in the early days of the counterfeits, they didn&#8217;t look like anything we made \u2013 they just featured our logo\u201d Tom states.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOver the last four years, counterfeiters have become more sophisticated, manufacturing products that look similar to the real-thing \u2013 while still using really cheap, sub-standard materials. We&#8217;ve had anecdotes of consumers having bought these fakes, believing they are real, only for teeth to fall out of the zipper when they take it out of the packaging.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom explains the growing threat to brand reputation caused by more sophisticated counterfeits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe had one consumer who unintentionally bought a counterfeit skiing jacket and used it for several months. When the product became faulty, he wanted to return it to us thinking it was genuine. We asked the consumer to send us pictures of the garment before we accepted the warranty return, and we could see it was a fake.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat hit me about these scenarios is that a consumer could use a counterfeit for almost a year, believing it was genuine, and think \u2018<em>It wasn&#8217;t bad, but it was nothing to write home about. I don&#8217;t see how they could ever charge $800. I&#8217;m glad I only paid $100.\u2019<\/em> That&#8217;s a real concern.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"973\" height=\"624\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/eBay-Counterfeit-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18619\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/eBay-Counterfeit-1.jpg 973w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/eBay-Counterfeit-1-300x192.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/eBay-Counterfeit-1-768x493.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px\" \/><figcaption>Example of counterfeit listing on eBay US<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns mb-0\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h2 class=\"heading-branded\">Arc&#8217;teryx&#8217;s approach<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Choosing Incopro as a brand protection vendor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe started using a firm for online enforcement around 2010. In those days, we were primarily concerned about the eBays and Amazons of the world. We used this firm for three years but found that these takedowns didn&#8217;t actually stay put and that some didn\u2019t even happen in the first place\u201d explains Tom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSubsequently we moved to another provider. They largely looked at marketplaces, but websites were also becoming an issue for us. We stayed with that provider for about six years. However, we were still playing whack-a-mole. And, of course, that always remains to a certain extent part of the game, but we were not seeing results. So, we took a step back and thought about it a little more carefully. We then decided to look for a new vendor.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe looked at four different vendors, including our current provider, but ended up choosing Incopro due to their technology and competitive pricing. We liked the look of Talisman [Incopro\u2019s brand protection platform] and felt it would give better visibility at my level, not just to Incopro\u2019s analysts. We also saw opportunities to use Talisman\u2019s network analysis functionality to collect information on networks of counterfeiters.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"487\" height=\"615\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Centrale-Parka-Women-s-Black-Full-View_edit1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18566\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Centrale-Parka-Women-s-Black-Full-View_edit1.jpg 487w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Centrale-Parka-Women-s-Black-Full-View_edit1-238x300.jpg 238w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns mb-0\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3>Incopro\u2019s data facilitates raids and criminal prosecutions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn 2019, our group was sold to a consortium that included the Chinese firm Anta. With that came connections to their brand protection team in China. We now take action on the ground in China to shut down counterfeiting operations and pursue criminal charges against them\u201d Tom states.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIncopro\u2019s platform has been really helpful for that, and the analysts in the Shanghai office work closely with our parent company. They gather information on networks of counterfeiters who are selling on Taobao or other Chinese marketplaces and pass that on, rather than sending takedown notices immediately \u2013 this is so we don\u2019t alert the counterfeiter that we&#8217;re actively investigating them.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnta then investigates further to find out where the counterfeiter\u2019s factories or warehouses are located and then pursues criminal charges. And we&#8217;ve been successful with this approach \u2013 initiating a number of raids against counterfeiting operations, with successful prosecutions following up. Compared to 2019, raids have increased by a factor of <strong>20<\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1015\" height=\"882\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/arcteryxclothing.shop-counterfeits.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18617\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/arcteryxclothing.shop-counterfeits.jpg 1015w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/arcteryxclothing.shop-counterfeits-300x261.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/arcteryxclothing.shop-counterfeits-768x667.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px\" \/><figcaption>Example of a website offering counterfeit Arc&#8217;teryx products.
