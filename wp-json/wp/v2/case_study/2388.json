Now into its sixth generation, the container has been designed to guarantee healthy root development and maximize aeration. The Air-Pots last up to ten years, and the company ensures that they have the strongest sustainability credentials by making them from recycled plastic.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" src=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Nursery_pot_1_edit.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Nursery_pot_1_edit.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Nursery_pot_1_edit-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.incoproip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Nursery_pot_1_edit-768x508.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-white\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left heading-branded\" id=\"h-the-counterfeiting-issue\">The counterfeiting issue<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>In the early 2000s, Caledonian Tree Company first noticed that they had a counterfeit issue coming out of China and as the popularity of their product grew, so did their infringement problem. The counterfeits they found were all about creating cheaply produced imitations of the Air-Pot that undercut the cost of the legitimate product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These illegitimate listings are easily confused by consumers with genuine Air-Pots when making purchases online. Counterfeits that do make their way into the hands of unsuspecting, would-be consumers, can damage the goodwill and trust carefully built by the company over the last two decades.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>The imitations are not created with the recycled plastic that is so core to the appeal of Air-Pots, and they often get the important details of the pot wrong that make such a difference in the success of the product. Counterfeiters are unable to provide the expert advice that is supplied by either Caledonian Tree Company or one of their distributors which can play a critical role in the successful use of the product for first-time buyers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-counterfeits-are-all-about-making-an-air-pot-people-can-buy-cheaper-than-ours-but-they-don-t-know-why-it-s-in-existence-and-they-don-t-know-how-to-advise-people-to-use-the-system\">\u201cCounterfeits are all about making an Air-Pot people can buy cheaper than ours, but they don\u2019t know why it\u2019s in existence and they don\u2019t know how to advise people to use the system\u201d<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie Single, Co-founder and Director<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group bg-primary--light\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center heading-branded\" id=\"h-fixing-the-problem\">Fixing the problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"h-prior-to-partnering-with-incopro\">Prior to partnering with Incopro <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Caledonian Tree Company attempted to stop the counterfeits internally.
