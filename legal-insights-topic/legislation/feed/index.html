<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-summary">Summary</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Also known as the ‘upload filter’, Article 17 of the EU&#8217;S DSM Directive introduces liability for online content-sharing service providers <span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;">(OCSSPs)</span> in instances of copyright infringement committed by their users. To avoid liability, these platforms must provide evidence that they have made &#8220;best efforts&#8221; to ensure that copyright-infringing content is removed when notified by brands and that they prevent its re-upload in the future.</strong></p>



<p>Jan Bernd Nordemann and Julian Waiblinger, experts at Nordemann, analyze Article 17 and note the following points about its international implementation: </p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>It is critical that the EU Member States implement the Art. 17 DSM Directive uniformly to avoid national differences.</li><li>Otherwise the market integration aim of harmonized copyright rules for OCSSPs cannot be achieved.</li><li>An implementation faithful to the wording of Art. 17 DSM Directive is the only option that achieves the Directive’s stated objective: the creation of a digital single market.  </li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Introduction </h2>



<p>Article 17&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Directive (EU) 2019/790</a>&nbsp;on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market (“DSM Directive”) is currently being implemented into national law in the EU Member States. This has caused extensive debates on the national level comparable to the debate that took place when Art. 17 DSM Directive was introduced in 2019. But one topic has hardly been addressed so far: the international application of Art. 17 DSM Directive – or, to be more precise, the international application of its national implementations. This contribution analyzes the international conflict of laws rules applicable to national legislation in cross-border scenarios within the EU. A thorough analysis shows why the EU needs a faithful implementation of Art. 17 DSM Directive into the laws of the EU Member States.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Art. 17 DSM Directive and Art. 3 InfoSoc Directive: Communication to the public</h2>



<p>There is some controversy as to how the right of communication to the public as mentioned in Art. 17(1) DSM Directive relates to the right of communication to the public enshrined in Art. 3&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32001L0029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Directive 2001/29/EC</a>&nbsp;on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (“InfoSoc Directive”). Some argue that Art. 17 DSM Directive introduces a&nbsp;<em>sui generis</em>&nbsp;right of communication to the public that would be different from the right of communication to the public as outlined in in Art. 3 InfoSoc Directive. This does not seem convincing, as we have laid out already (see&nbsp;<a href="http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2020/07/16/art-17-dsmcd-a-class-of-its-own-how-to-implement-art-17-into-the-existing-national-copyright-acts-including-a-comment-on-the-recent-german-discussion-draft-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2020/07/17/art-17-dsmcd-a-class-of-its-own-how-to-implement-art-17-into-the-existing-national-copyright-acts-including-a-comment-on-the-recent-german-discussion-draft-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>).</p>



<p>That said, from an international conflict of laws perspective, it seems plausible that the&nbsp;<em>sui generis</em>&nbsp;approach mentioned would also follow the same conflict of law rules in international scenarios as Art. 3 InfoSoc Directive. As will be outlined below, these rules have already been applied to&nbsp;<em>sui generis</em>&nbsp;right protection in the field of databases.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded"><strong>International application of Art. 3 InfoSoc Directive or Art. 17 DSM Directive in cross-border scenarios: CJEU&nbsp;<em>Football Dataco/Sportradar</em></strong></h2>



<p>To date, there is no CJEU case law on the international application of Art. 3 InfoSoc Directive or Art. 17 DSM Directive in cross-border scenarios. However, the available case law regarding related provisions of EU law arguably also applies to the right of communication to the public pursuant Art. 3 InfoSoc Directive and Art. 17 DSM Directive. This is in particular true for the leading case CJEU&nbsp;<em>Football Dataco/Sportradar&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-173/11&amp;language=EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C-173/11</a>).</p>



<p>Although this decision only concerns the “re-utilization” of databases protected by the&nbsp;<em>sui generis&nbsp;</em>right (related right) of the EU Database Directive 96/9, there are strong arguments that the decision also applies to Art. 3 InfoSoc Directive as a conflict of law rule governing its international application. The Database Directive 96/9 obliges Member States to provide two separate forms of protection for databases: copyright and a&nbsp;<em>sui generis&nbsp;</em>database right (related right). The&nbsp;<em>sui generis&nbsp;</em>database right affords the maker of a qualifying database the right to prevent the unauthorized “extraction and/or re-utilization” of the whole or a substantial part of its contents. The right of “re-utilization” pursuant to Art. 7(2)(b) Database Directive is defined as “<em>any form of making available to the public all or a substantial part of the contents of a database by … online or other forms of transmission</em>.” In&nbsp;<em>Football Dataco/Sportradar</em>, the CJEU held (para. 21):&nbsp;<em>“That concept covers an act, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, in which a person sends, by means of his web server, to another person’s computer, at that person’s request, data previously extracted from the content of a database protected by the sui generis right. By such a sending, that data is made available to a member of the public.”&nbsp;</em>This is exactly what communication to the public covers under copyright and the related rights pursuant to Art. 3 InfoSoc Directive.</p>



<p>What also speaks in favor of applying&nbsp;<em>Football Dataco/Sportradar</em>&nbsp;to the international application of Art. 3 InfoSoc and Art. 17 DSM Directive is the following: it is established case law of the CJEU to interpret provisions which “have the same trigger” in parallel (see e.g. CJEU&nbsp;<a href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-117/15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C-117/15</a>&nbsp;paras 32, 34 –&nbsp;<em>Reha Training</em>).</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded"><strong>The rules set by CJEU Dataco/Sportradar</strong></h2>



<p>In&nbsp;<em>Football Dataco/Sportradar&nbsp;</em>the CJEU held that as a conflict of law rule, the country of protection principle pursuant to Art. 8 (1) Rome II Regulation 864/2007 (“Rome II”) applied (paras 31, 32). It held that the mere fact that the website containing the content in question was accessible in a particular national territory was not a sufficient basis for concluding that the operator of the website was performing an infringing act caught by the national law applicable in that territory (paras 36, 37). Rather, it held: “<em>The localization of an act … in the territory of the Member State … depends on there being evidence from which it may be concluded that the act discloses an&nbsp;<u>intention</u>&nbsp;on the part of its performer&nbsp;<u>to target persons in that territory</u></em>.” (Para. 39 with further references).</p>



<p>The most important factors/indications to determine whether an offer is targeted at the public of a particular EU Member State include:</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>Awareness that the public in that EU Member State is using the content. (CJEU&nbsp;<em>Football Dataco/Sportradar&nbsp;</em>(C-173/11)</li></ul>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>Use of language / currency / payment methods aimed at the respective public in that EU Member State. (CJEU&nbsp;<em>Pammer</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Alpenhof</em>&nbsp;(C 585/08 and C 144/09)</li></ul>



<ul><li>Use of advertising content aimed at the respective public in that EU Member State. (CJEU&nbsp;<em>Donner</em>&nbsp;(C-5/11)</li></ul>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>Use of a top-level domain name unspecific to the state in which the OCSSP is established. (CJEU&nbsp;<em>Pammer</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Alpenhof</em>&nbsp;(C 585/08 and C 144/09)</li></ul>



<p>Consequently, the national implementations of Art. 17 DSM Directive will also have to follow the conflict of laws rules determined by Art. 8 (1) Rome II Regulation and the CJEU interpretation in&nbsp;<em>Football Dataco</em>. This seems to be common sense in academic literature at least as far as an infringement of the right of communication is in question<a href="http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2021/06/21/art-17-dsm-directive-international-application-in-eu-cross-border-scenarios-or-why-the-eu-needs-a-faithful-implementation-into-national-law/#_ftn1">[1]</a>. The German Government in its draft law to implement the DSM Directive into German law shares the view that Art. 8(1) Rome II Regulation applies to infringements of the right of communication to the public as laid out in Art. 17 DSM Directive<a href="http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2021/06/21/art-17-dsm-directive-international-application-in-eu-cross-border-scenarios-or-why-the-eu-needs-a-faithful-implementation-into-national-law/#_ftn2">[2]</a>.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">The problem of a “mosaic approach”</h2>



<p>Consequently, concerning conflict of laws in international (EU cross-border) scenarios, the application of national law (implementing Art. 17 DSM Directive) pursuant to Art. 8 (1) Rome II will be determined for communication to the public by answering the question to what public was the copyrighted content targeted by the OCSSP? The law of every country will apply, where the public was (at least also) targeted. Regarding communication to the public on the internet and tortious liability, this will lead to what is called a “mosaic approach”.</p>



<p>An infringer would face liability in different EU Member States where its communication (of the copyright work) is targeted to the public in different EU Member States. This could even be the case if specific pieces of content (rather than the service as such) are targeted at the public of that EU Member State<a href="http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2021/06/21/art-17-dsm-directive-international-application-in-eu-cross-border-scenarios-or-why-the-eu-needs-a-faithful-implementation-into-national-law/#_ftn3">[3]</a>. As a consequence, an OCSSP can be caught by multiple national implementations of Art. 17 DSM Directive, if the OCSSP targets multiple EU Member States.</p>



<p>Differing implementations of Art. 17 DSM Directive in different EU Member States will lead to the following consequences:</p>



<ul><li>Either: An OCSSP would have to prevent the availability of its services in some territories so as to avoid being caught by different national liability regimes, which set conflicting duties for the OCSSP compared to other EU Member States. One example would be unique national provisions, such as those prohibiting OCSSPs from taking measures to prevent the availability of unauthorized content in some circumstances (for instance in the case of “presumably permitted uses” under the German implementation law) conflicting with duties from other EU Member States setting duties pursuant to the wording of Art. 17 (4) and (5) DSM Directive, where no presumed legal uses may be found and duties are rather shaped on a case-by-case basis in view of proportionality. As a result, services would likely not be offered cross-border in the EU.</li><li>Or: OCSSPs would have to refrain from targeting Member States with deviant rules in more than one Member State. Of course, this will be somewhat difficult for EU Member States which are regularly targeted together. For example, it could be difficult for a French OCSSP not to also target Belgium, as Belgium also officially speaks French; advertisements to the French public will usually also be useful for the French speaking part of Belgium. Against this background, it will be complex for an OCSSP to avoid addressing the public in several Member States without geolocation. Anyway, a lot of content will be suitable to target different Member States even with different languages, with the OCSSP monetizing the content using targeted advertising to local audiences. And the currency would be the same for the entire Euro-zone.</li><li>Or: The OCSSP complies with the strictest liability regime within the EU. But this alternative will not be at hand if another implementing EU Member State obliges the OCSSP to not block unauthorized content (e.g. “presumably permitted”, but potentially infringing uploads as in the German implementation law).</li></ul>



<p>The problematic consequences associated with differing implementations of Art. 17 DSM Directive in different EU Member States have already been highlighted in current academic literature. See for example&nbsp;<em>Metzger/Senftleben</em>&nbsp;(op cit., page 20):&nbsp;<em>“The effect of such a literal application of Article 8(1) Rome II would be that OCSSPs would either apply geoblocking technology to comply with the requirements of the different member states or comply with the strictest regime all over Europe.”</em></p>



<p>Against this background,&nbsp;<em>Metzger/Senftleben</em>&nbsp;(op cit.) propose interpreting Art. 3 E-Commerce Directive generously. They brought up the question whether all issues regulated in Art. 17 DSM Directive are to be characterized as questions of copyright which are exempt from the country of origin of Art. 3 E-Commerce Directive. While this might work for certain aspects of Art. 17 DSM Directive such as the regulation of the procedural safeguards, the core issue of liability for copyright infringement cannot be solved through Art. 3 E-Commerce Directive 2000/31 and its country-of-origin principle. Copyright rules are expressly excluded from the country-of-origin principle pursuant to Art. 3 E-Commerce Directive (see Art. 3 (3) E-Commerce-Directive and Annex). Copyright liability rules quite clearly fall into this category of copyright rules.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Consequence: The EU Member States should implement Art. 17 DSM Directive avoiding national differences</h2>



<p>In light of these consequences associated with a non-uniform implementation, it is of the utmost importance that the EU Member States implement Art. 17 DSM Directive in a way that avoids national differences, as otherwise the market integration aim of harmonized copyright rules for OCSSPs cannot be achieved. On the contrary, the DSM Directive’s political goal of further harmonization of Union law would be reversed.</p>



<p>Consequently, an implementation faithful to the wording, i.e. close to a verbatim implementation, of Art. 17 DSM Directive is the only option that achieves the Directive’s stated objective, the creation of a digital single market. Otherwise, the Directive’s goal of harmonizing and creating a digital single market could be severely hindered. Member States should not seek to create national divergences or promote bespoke interpretations of Article 17, lest they risk undermining rather than supporting the digital single market. &nbsp;Instead, as the CJEU case law develops around Art. 17 DSM Directive, it will in due course solidify and further codify the application and interpretation of the Article. The judgment of the CJEU in case&nbsp;<a href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?oqp=&amp;for=&amp;mat=or&amp;lgrec=en&amp;jge=&amp;td=%3BALL&amp;jur=C%2CT%2CF&amp;num=C-401%252F19&amp;page=1&amp;dates=&amp;pcs=Oor&amp;lg=&amp;pro=&amp;nat=or&amp;cit=none%252CC%252CCJ%252CR%252C2008E%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252Ctrue%252Cfalse%252Cfalse&amp;language=en&amp;avg=&amp;cid=15264614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C-401/19</a>&nbsp;Republic of Poland/European Parliament and Council of the European Union, which can be expected later in 2021, could already shed light on the application of the Article. The CJEU may also interpret Art. 17 DSM Directive in cases C-682/18 Frank Peterson/Google LLC, YouTube LLC, YouTube Inc. and Google Germany GmbH and C-682/18 Elsevier Inc./Cyando AG, for which the judgment date has been set for June 22, 2021.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-key-summary">Key summary</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>In 2021, EU Member States have to implement provisions about commercial communication including the product placement regulation resulting from the Audiovisual and Media Services (AVMS) Directive[1].</strong></p>



<ul><li>Even if the legal regime of product placement on audiovisual media services is changing &#8211; with its authorisation becoming the principle and its prohibition the exception &#8211; its conditions of implementation remain nearly the same. </li></ul>



<ul><li>What do brands need to know?<br><br>1. The legal regime for product placement<br>2. The requirements for lawful product placement<br>3. The ongoing restrictions around product placement</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-introduction">Introduction</h2>



<p>Product placement is an opportunity for brand visibility, It is also an advertising practice that consists in placing one&#8217;s trademark or product visibly in a film, a television programme, a music video or a post on social networks.</p>



<p>As regards the latter, product placement enjoys the popularity of advertisers as they offer alternative outlets to traditional advertising channels. Therefore, advertisers are increasingly working with influencers to post advertising content but in a framework which is often unclear and which can mislead viewers about the true nature of the message being broadcast.</p>



<p>Legally, product placement is governed by European Union law, where it is defined as any form of audiovisual commercial communication consisting in the inclusion of, or reference to, a product, a service or the trademark thereof so that it is featured within a programme or a user-generated video in return for payment or for similar consideration[2].</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-is-the-legal-regime-for-product-placement-today">What is the legal regime for product placement today?</h2>



<p>Prior to the amendment of the AVMS Directive, the principle was the prohibition of product placement on all audiovisual media services – except in a very limited number of cases.</p>



<p>The amended AVMS Directive has reversed the principle and the exceptions and allowed product placement in all circumstances for all [3]audiovisual media services. Indeed, in its recitals, the amended AVMS Directive states that the past general prohibition did not provide legal certainty for media service providers[4].</p>



<p>One should note the significance of this new principle since the revised AVMS directive has a very broad scope and applies to any social networks, video sharing platforms, live-streaming services – that are considered, in any case, as audiovisual media services[5].</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-are-the-requirements-for-lawful-product-placement">What are the requirements for lawful product placement?</h2>



<p>Programmes that include product placement must comply with the following three formal conditions – compliance with which is governed by each Member States’ TV and radio regulatory body:</p>



<ul type="i"><li>1. Their content and organisation within a schedule, in the case of television broadcasting, or within a catalogue, in the case of on-demand audiovisual media services, shall in no circumstances be influenced in such a way as to affect the responsibility and editorial independence of the media service provider;</li><li>2. They shall not directly encourage the purchase or rental of goods or services, in particular by making specific promotional references to those goods or services;</li><li>3. They do not give undue prominence to the product in question[6].</li></ul>



<p>Morevover, Member States shall ensure that product placement in the context of audiovisual commercial communications provided by media service providers, comply with the following requirements:</p>



<ul><li>Product placement is <strong>recognisable as such.</strong></li></ul>



<p>In other words, spectator shall be clearly informed of the existence of product placement by means of appropriate identification at the beginning and end of the programme.</p>



<p>However, the amended AVMS directive does not identify any particular means of ensuring compliance with this principle &#8211; unlike the product placement on television, where the pictogram “P” is supposed to inform viewers of the existence of product placement for one minute at the beginning of a programme and after each advertising break, as well as for the duration of the end credits.</p>



<p>In the case of <em>Youtube</em>, a content declaration mechanism exists and invites the user to fill in information intended to identify the audiovisual commercial communication nature of the video in question. Once filled in, this declaration is supposed to trigger the display of a notice on top of the video.</p>



<ul><li>Product placement does <strong>not use subliminal techniques</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>Put another way, product placement will be regarded as surreptitious advertising[7] when it does not offer proper information and should be sanctioned as such.</p>



<p>In the case of television, in the event of surreptitious advertising, the editor in question is subject to formal notices from the CSA to comply with the regulations and might, where appropriate, be penalised financially. Sometimes, sanctions may even include the suspension of a programme.</p>



<p>Product placement does not:</p>



<ul><li>Prejudice respect for human dignity;</li><li>Include or promote any discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, nationality, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation;</li><li>Encourage behaviour prejudicial to health or safety;</li><li>Encourage behaviour grossly prejudicial to the protection of the environment[8]</li></ul>



<p>In particular, product placement shall not cause physical, mental or moral harm to minors.</p>



<p>To this end, it should not:</p>



<ul><li>Directly encourage minors to buy or rent a product or service by exploiting their inexperience or credulity;</li><li>Directly encouraging minors to persuade their parents or others to purchase the goods or services being advertised;</li><li>Exploit the special trust minors have in their parents, teachers or others;</li><li>Present minors in a dangerous situation without a reason[9].</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-ongoing-restrictions-around-product-placement">Ongoing Restrictions around Product Placement</h2>



<h3 id="h-prohibitions-related-to-the-programme-in-question">Prohibitions related to the programme in question</h3>



<p>There are four exceptions to the principle of product placement in view of the programme in question<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>:</p>



<ul><li>News and current affairs programmes ;</li><li>Consumer programmes,</li><li>Religious programmes ;</li><li>Children&#8217;s programmes &#8211; as children are generally unable to recognise commercial content<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>.</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-prohibitions-related-to-the-products-involved">Prohibitions related to the products involved</h3>



<p>Some products are not eligible for product placement, <em>per se</em>, namely:</p>



<ul><li>Cigarettes and other tobacco products, as well as electronic cigarettes and refill bottles, or product placement from companies whose principal activity is the manufacture or sale of these products;</li><li>Specific medicinal products or medical treatments available only on prescription in the Member State under whose jurisdiction the media service provider falls[12].</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>In conclusion, the new legal regime of product placement represents the next phase of advertising regulation in Europe, for brands.</p>



<p>In addition, as seen in France, this transposition comes at the same time as the discussion on a law bill which may include provisions relating to the regulation of advertising (e.g. ban advertising for fossil fuels) and illustrates the contemporary, societal and environmental questioning relating to the regulation of this sector – that may concern trademarks owners.</p>
