<h2 class="heading-branded">Key summary</h2>



<p>Vorwek holds a European patent validated in Spain that protects the technology incorporated in a food processor popularly known as Thermomix®. Lidl manufactures a similar food processor, but marketed at a much lower price, commercially identified as ‘Monsieur Cuisine Connect’.</p>



<p>In January 2021, a Barcelona court found Lidl guilty of patent infringement of the Thermomix® food processor. However, in February 2022, the Barcelona Court of Appeals overturned this ruling and revoked the Thermomix® patent.</p>



<p><strong>Key facts and takeaways:</strong></p>



<ul><li>The Barcelona Court of Appeals upheld the appeal filed by LIDL against the judgment handed down by Commercial Court No. 5 of Barcelona which had condemned LIDL for patent infringement.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Court of Appeals’ ruling states that WORWERK&#8217;s European patent is invalid on two grounds: addition of new matter and lack of inventive step. Furthermore, even if it were valid, it would not have been infringed.</li></ul>



<ul><li>This judgment could still be subject of a cassation appeal before the Supreme Court. But for the time being LIDL will be able to resume marketing its Monsieur Cuisine Connect food processor, which had been withdrawn from the market as ordered by the first instance judgment.</li></ul>



<p>The first instance Court had set the bar for inventive step very low, as it admitted that the inventive step lay more in the new functionality incorporated into the food processor (independence of the stirring process from the weighing process) than in the way it is achieved, which is very simple.</p>



<p>The solution adopted by the patent was so simple that the Court of Appeals took a different view, considering that the solution was in the state of the art and so simple that it was obvious to a person skilled in the art.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Introduction</h2>



<p>In its Judgment of 13 January 2022, the 15th Section of the Barcelona Court of Appeals upheld the appeal filed by LIDL against the judgment handed down by Commercial Court No. 5 of Barcelona which had condemned LIDL for patent infringement. The dispute concerns the European patent validated in Spain which protected the technology incorporated in the food processor popularly known on the market by its brand name Thermomix®.</p>



<p>In the first instance judgment, LIDL was prohibited from importing, advertising or marketing its ‘Monsieur Cuisine Connect’ food processor, for infringing – as it was declared – the patent of VORWERK, the manufacturer of the Thermomix®.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-patent-invalidity">Patent invalidity</h2>



<p>At the appeal stage, the situation has changed. The Court of Appeals’ ruling states that WORWERK’s European patent is invalid on two grounds: addition of new matter and lack of inventive step. Furthermore, even if it were valid, it would not have been infringed.</p>



<p>The judgment upheld the&nbsp;<strong><u>addition of new subject matter</u></strong>&nbsp;as a ground for invalidity on the grounds that “<em>the protection was unlawfully extended in the course of the patent prosecution</em>“. In other words, VORWERK included new elements in its patent application during its prosecution before the European Patent Office (EPO), which is not permitted.</p>



<p>The court is of the opinion that “the fact that the initial description mentions separately two functions of the control board (stirring and heating) and makes no reference to the weighing device prevents it from being considered that this application disclosed the idea of a weighing device controlled by an autonomous circuit of the same control board as the stirring device and the heating device” […]; and that “it is clear that this disclosure is not made expressly and we do not believe that it is made implicitly”. Therefore, the final wording of the claim, by including these features, infringed the prohibition on extending protection over what was originally claimed. This leads to the invalidation of R1 (main claim) for extension of subject matter and, with it, the entire patent.</p>



<p>As regards the requirement of&nbsp;<strong><u>inventive step</u></strong>, the Judgment analyses the differences between the two companies’ food processors in the safety system of the glass in which the food is introduced. It examines whether the LIDL robot incorporates feature R.1.1 of the WORWERK patent (safety system). In this respect the court states that “the dispute centres on whether in the defendant’s product the stirring bowl and the lid can be interlocked in such a way that no intervention inside the stirring bowl is possible during operation. The defendant argues that in order to be able to intervene in the beaker it is necessary to stop the stirring mechanism beforehand, whereas the plaintiff argues that unlocking the lid deactivates the switch and stops supplying power to the stirring mechanism”. The Board then concludes, “we believe that of these two interpretations of the title, the one that best fits the description is the one given by the defendant. We reach this conclusion considering that the patent does not claim any new solution in relation to the safety system which was already part of the state of the art but merely reproduces a solution of the prior art which consists, in substance, in the fact that the lid cannot be unlocked unless the agitator mechanism is first switched off”.</p>



<p>In other words, it is claimed that the feature claimed as a solution to the technical problem was already in the prior art, so that for a skilled person, it would have been an obvious solution to that problem.</p>



<p>The judgment concludes by declaring the nullity of WORWERK’s Spanish patent ES 2 301 589, validation of the European patent EP 1 269 898, entitled “Cooking machine”.</p>



<p>As the patent is invalid, both for addition of new subject matter and for lack of inventive step, there is no longer any need to examine whether there is infringement (an invalid patent cannot be infringed). But the Judgment further states that, even if WORVERK’s patent were valid, it would not have been infringed by LIDL.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-non-infringement">Non-infringement</h2>



<p>WORWEK claimed that LIDL had reproduced one of the features claimed in its patent, consisting of the safety system that prevents the lid of the mixing bowl from being removed without first stopping the robot. However, the Provincial Court declared that “there is no infringement because the defendant’s [LIDL] food processor does not reproduce the sequence necessary for safe intervention in the shaker cup. In the Lidl food processor, the lid can be opened without the need for any prior action, i.e. without the need to stop the stirring mechanism beforehand, and it is that opening or unlatching of the lid by means of a small turn on its axis which stops the stirring mechanism, albeit not immediately’. In Lidl’s machine, the blades stop when the lid is opened and can maintain an inertia of operation with the lid open.</p>



<p>Thus, the Lidl robot does not need to stop the cooking process to open the lid, unlike the Thermomix. This would show, in principle, that Lidl would not have reproduced WORWERK’s patent on this aspect. So even if the patent were valid, there would be no infringement either.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-possible-cassation-appeal">Possible cassation appeal</h2>



<p>Although this judgment could still be subject to appeal before the Supreme Court (possible appeals in cassation and extraordinary appeals for procedural infringement), for the time being LIDL will be able to resume marketing its Monsieur Cousine Connect food processor, which had been withdrawn from the market as ordered by the first instance judgment.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>What is most striking in this case is the different approach to inventive step taken by the lower court and the Court of Appeals. In our <a href="https://santiagomediano.com/en/a-barcelona-court-finds-lidl-guilty-of-patent-infringement-of-the-thermomix-food-processor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commentary on the first instance judgment</a>, we already noted that the Court had set the bar for inventive step very low, as it admitted that the inventive step lay more in the new functionality incorporated into the food processor (independence of the stirring process from the weighing process) than in the way it is achieved, which is very simple. The lower court even stated that «<em>because of the simplicity of the invention, any technical expert would have been “able” to reach it</em>». However, “<em>it is precisely in the simplicity that the inventive step lies, because the person skilled in the art must overcome the mental barrier that no one has done something so supposedly simple before</em>“. The solution adopted by the patent was so simple that the Court of Appeals took a different view, considering that the solution was in the state of the art and so simple that it was obvious to a person skilled in the art. It is not enough for the functionality sought to be creative; the way in which it is achieved must also be creative.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Key Summary</h2>



<p>Katharine Hepburn, Associate at Wiggin, analyzes a recent High Court case between Claimants <strong>OBTC</strong>, that sell luxury ‘bandage’ and ‘bodycon’ style dresses under the brands of ‘House of CB’ and ‘Mistress Rocks’, and Defendants <strong>G4K</strong>, that sell the same style dresses under the brand &#8216;Oh Polly.&#8217; </p>



<p>The case brought before the Court alleged that G4K had copied the designs of several OBTC&#8217;s dresses. Ruling in favour of the Claimants, the High Court agreed that G4K had committed flagrant infringement and that the company must pay significant damages to OBTC.</p>



<p>Key facts and takeaways:</p>



<ul><li>In February 2021, the High Court held that seven of G4K’s garments infringed OBTC’s UK and Community unregistered design rights</li><li>On 20 December 2021, the High Court awarded damages of over £450,000 to OBTC, which included an additional damages uplift of 200%</li><li>This case presents valuable insight into how additional damages are awarded in IP cases in the UK</li><li>It highlights the danger of taking too much inspiration from competitor&#8217;s products </li><li>It also reassures brand owners of the strength of unregistered design rights in the fashion sector, so long as there is evidence of copying</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-background">Background</h2>



<p>The Claimants (Original Beauty Technology Company Ltd and others (<strong>OBTC</strong>)) sell luxury ‘bandage’ and ‘bodycon’ style dresses under the trading brands of ‘House of CB’ and ‘Mistress Rocks’. The dresses have been worn by celebrities including Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez.</p>



<p>The Defendants (G4K Fashion Ltd and others (<strong>G4K</strong>)) sell ‘bandage’ and ‘bodycon’ dresses in competition with House of CB under the brand ‘Oh Polly’.</p>



<p>In February 2021, Mr David Stone, sitting as a Deputy High Court judge gave judgment on the merits, holding that seven of G4K’s’ garments infringed OBTC’s UK and Community unregistered design rights. Further, he found that G4K’s flagrant infringement and <em>“couldn’t care less attitude” </em>warranted an award of additional damages. Evidence included the deliberate sending of images of OBTC’s products to G4K’s factories for them to be copied.</p>



<p>On 20 December 2021, Mr Stone handed down a lengthy decision following a damages inquiry, and awarded damages of over £450,000 to OBTC, which included an additional damages uplift of 200%.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Facts and liability judgment</h2>



<p>OBTC’s initial case was based on the assertion that G4K copied 91 of their garment designs. The claims were based on UK unregistered design rights (<strong>UKUDR</strong>); community unregistered design rights (<strong>CUDR</strong>); and passing off.</p>



<p>UKUDR protects original, non-commonplace designs for the shape or configuration of the whole or part of an article. Infringement occurs where (i) the design has been copied; and (ii) the alleged infringement has been made exactly or substantially to the claimants’ design.</p>



<p>CUDR protects novel designs with individual character for the appearance of whole or part of a product. Individual character exists when the designs do not produce the same overall impression on the informed user as prior designs. Infringement occurs where (i) the design has been copied; and (ii) the alleged infringement produces the same overall impression on the informed user as the claimants’ design.</p>



<p>UKUDR and CUDR were held to validly subsist and infringement was found in relation to seven of the designs.</p>



<p>Key to the finding of copying was evidence that G4K’s CEO and designer had lied in evidence about the design process (wherein she claimed to have researched trends &nbsp;from images in her Dropbox and designed the garments in her head, then looked for existing garments to show her factory what she wanted made) which was held to be a <em>“fabrication”</em> to get around the fact that she took images of the OBTC garments and sent them to the factory to be made. Mr Stone held that she set out to deceive OBTC and the court in relation to the design process. Such actions were deemed <em>“sufficient to warrant an award of additional damages in relation to those designs. It was at least an attitude of “couldn’t care less” about the rights of others”.</em></p>



<p>The passing off claims failed, although the judge came to his conclusion <em>“with some reluctance”</em>, on the basis that although there was an intent to ride on the coat tails of the OBTC, the public had not been deceived into thinking the brands were associated.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Damages ruling</h2>



<h3>Standard damages</h3>



<p>The decision provides a useful recollection as to the legal tests to be applied regarding the award of standard damages. The key principles were summarised by Kitchen J (as he then was) in <em>Ultraframe Eurocell[1]</em> and include the following:</p>



<ul><li>Damages are compensatory (rather than punitive) and the general rule is that they should, as far as possible, put the claimant in the same position as they would have been in if they had not sustained the wrong/the infringement not occurred;</li><li>The claimant can recover loss which was (i) foreseeable; (ii) caused by the wrong; and (iii) not excluded from recovery by public or social policy; and</li><li>Where the claimant has exploited their rights, they can claim:<ul><li>Lost profit on sales they would have made but for the defendant’s sales, and on their own sales to the extent the infringement forced them to make a price reduction; and</li></ul><ul><li>A reasonable royalty on sales by the defendant which the claimant would not have made. The ‘reasonable royalty’ is to be assessed on the basis of the royalty that a willing licensor and a willing licensee would have agreed, using evidence of any truly comparable licences as guidance or otherwise based on apportioning the profit available from the infringing sales.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The judge recognised the difficulty in establishing a precise figure based on the hypothetical situation where G4K had not infringed, and stated that the court’s role was to <em>“do the best job it can with the material the parties have put before it” [by] “having regard to all the circumstances of the case and dealing with the matter broadly, with common sense and fairness”.</em></p>



<h3>Damages for loss of profit on lost sales</h3>



<p>OBTC’s case on lost profit damages was based on the number of OBTC’s lost sales multiplied by OBTC’s per unit profit. In order to assess the number of its lost sales, the total number of G4K’s sales was multiplied by a probability that a sale would instead have been made by OBTC – “P”.</p>



<p>G4K agreed with this method but disputed the value of “P”.</p>



<p>The judge followed a two-stage approach: firstly, assessing if there were any lost sales, and only if there were then secondly, how many. The judge held that P was 0.2 and awarded £74,847.92 in lost profits.</p>



<p>Factors put forward by the parties and considered by the court included the nature of the parties’ businesses and that they are competitors, that the driving factor behind purchases was the look of the garment on the website and there was an overlap in customer demographic.</p>



<h3>Reasonable royalty</h3>



<p>The parties were in agreement that damages should also be awarded on the basis of a reasonable royalty, which can only apply to sales which have not been compensated for as sales lost by the Claimant (above).</p>



<p>Although forensic accountancy evidence on the quantum of lost sales and reasonable royalty rates was relied upon, Mr Stone found it unhelpful and said <em>“it is for the court to assess the hypothetical negotiation between two willing parties in order to try to reach a reasonable royalty”.</em></p>



<p>The difficulties in doing so were noted, particularly given that there were no comparable licences available and that the evidence from both sides was that they would never have entered into an agreement with each other and if they had, would never have negotiated beyond their own <em>“red lines”.</em></p>



<p>OBTC claimed the reasonable royalty should be £170,000 (£11 per garment) whereas G4K stated it was around £15,000 (£1 per garment).</p>



<p>The judge awarded reasonable royalty damages in the sum of £75,276.64. He arrived at this figure based on the following:</p>



<ul><li>The royalty would have been based on G4K’s net sales revenue;</li><li>Partial and whole designs would have been treated the same – as a design conscious business seeking to attract customers looking for “trends” it was the trend that was important to G4K;</li><li>G4K had no other sources of on-trend designs from a successful business and so to be able to license OBTC’s designs it would have paid an above-average royalty rate of 10%;</li><li>OBTC were not running a licensing business and so any agreement would have had to have been worth the administrative effort, such that OBTC would have wanted a minimum licence fee which was deemed to be £4,000 per design; and</li><li>This royalty would have eaten into the G4K’s profits but not led to a loss. Further, they could have increased their prices to increase the profit margin (and based on evidence, they would have readily done so).</li></ul>



<h3>Additional damages</h3>



<p>Pursuant to section 229(2) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the court may award <em>“such additional damages as the justice of the case may require” “having regard to all the circumstances”.</em></p>



<p>G4K accepted that OBTC were entitled to additional damages resulting from the flagrancy of the infringement.</p>



<p>The judge referred to the principles set out in the leading case on additional damages (<em>PPL v Ellis[2]</em>), including that additional damages may be partly or wholly punitive; serve as a valuable deterrent effect to the infringer; must be <em>“effective, proportionate and dissuasive”</em> and that a particularly egregious award would amount to an abuse of rights.</p>



<p>Mr Stone commented that there is a lack of guidance on how to calculate additional damages and there is no general approach to take.</p>



<p>G4K proposed an uplift of 20% of the standard damages award. OBTC sought the total sum they would have received if they, rather than G4K, had made every infringing sale (over £500,000) or total revenues made by G4K for those sales (£451,188).</p>



<p>The judge awarded additional damages of £300,000 (200% uplift on the standard damages) and said that <em>“only an award of this size will be sufficient to punish them for what they have done, and to deter them from infringing again”.</em></p>



<p>Factors considered included:</p>



<ul><li>The large-scale infringement: the judge rejected arguments that the infringement was small scale when considered as a proportion of the G4K’s business – over 15,000 garments over 4 years was large-scale infringement;</li><li>The dishonest evidence of G4K‘s key witness;</li><li>G4K’s continuing denial of copying throughout trial;</li><li>Despite receiving a letter from OBTC in 2016, the last infringing garment was first marketed for sale 10 days after the Claim Form was sent to them and thereafter, sales continued up until the liability trial was underway;</li><li>The success of and resources available to G4K were relevant to the deterrent effective and what would make an award <em>“effective, proportionate and dissuasive”.</em></li></ul>



<p>The total award was therefore in the sum of £450,124.56 (which represented more than the gross profit received by G4K).</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Wiggin Comment</h2>



<p>This case offers rare guidance into additional damages awards in IP cases and acts both as a warning against taking too much inspiration from competitor products; and reassurance as to the strength of unregistered design rights in the fashion sector, so long as there is evidence of copying. The decision also serves to emphasise the importance of conduct in proceedings.</p>

<p>Read full analysis of the case below by Gie van den Broek, Attorney at Netherlands-based law firm LXA.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Introduction</h2>



<p>In many jurisdictions, counterfeit trade is not high on the priority list for law enforcement. However, in the Netherlands, this can change when the financial magnitude of the criminal offence is larger and the Fiscal Fraud Police gets involved.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">The Court case</h2>



<p>In the above case two persons were summoned by the Public Prosecutor after a criminal investigation by FIOD (Dutch Fiscal Fraud Police, hereafter DFFP) including wiretaps and seizures. Defendants were suspect of counterfeiting in a professional way, as a company (aggravating circumstance in Dutch Penal Law) and moreover they were also suspect of habitual money laundering of the money earned with the manufacture and trade of counterfeit products, i.a. Canada Goose, Parajumpers and Stone Island jackets. They invested the money earned i.a. in real estate.</p>



<p>The defence did not get much further than a bare denial of the facts. The DFFP found multiple Marktplaats listings operated by the Defendants in which the counterfeit coats were offered for sale.</p>



<p>During a seizure in March 2018, a stamp machine, several stamps bearing the brand Canada Goose and Stone Island, six sewing machines and over 10,000 counterfeited labels were found at the house of one of the joint offenders.</p>



<p>He declared during an interrogation that he already was already active since 2016 sewing in badges and affixing labels in unbranded jackets coming in from Italy in turn for getting paid.</p>



<p>The DFFP found evidence of €442,217.32 spent in cash. The suspicion of habitual money laundering was considered proven by the Court, since the Defendant could not explain the difference between earnings and withdrawals. An amount of €436,501.67 was proven to be money laundered. The Defendant did not show in the accounts the differences and only exercised his right to remain silent.</p>



<p>In view of the size of the amount declared proven and the period in which the expenses and deposits were made, the Court found it proven that the suspect has made a habit of money laundering. The Court also found it proven that the suspect laundered the total amount of money with another person, namely his partner (co-defendant).</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Considerations of the Court</h2>



<p>Whereas the Public Prosecutor claimed 12 months imprisonment, with a suspended sentence of 6 months with an operational period of two years, and confiscation of the house of the Defendant, the Court had to bear in mind the undue delay rules of Article 6 ECHR.</p>



<h3>1. Counterfeiting and unfair competition</h3>



<p>The suspect was complicit in commercial trade in counterfeit goods for a year and a half. The trademarks and copyright of several rights holders have been infringed. There is also unfair competition with respect to bona fide companies that do respect the interests of those rights holders. The brand owners themselves lose revenue if potential customers buy the counterfeit items instead of the original items.</p>



<h3>2. Habitual money laundering</h3>



<p>The Defendant laundered almost half a million euros amount with his partner and made it a habit. With that money, the two suspects partly paid for their new house, renovated it and had a new bathroom and kitchen installed. By introducing criminal money into the legal payment system, the suspect and fellow suspect cooperated in concealing criminal activities and income from them. This encourages criminal behavior because it can create the impression that illegally acquiring income pays off. This also disadvantages the State, and therefore society, because no tax is paid on that criminal income. Furthermore, money laundering poses a serious threat to the legal economy and affects the integrity of financial and economic transactions.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-the-court-decision">The Court decision</h2>



<p>The Court decided a sentence of 10 months, of which 4 on probation, with the operational period of 2 years. The Court rejected the confiscation claim from the Public Prosecutor and held that this additional punishment to be currently disproportionate, partly in view of the fact that no further investigation had been carried out into the house and nothing is known about, for example, its value. Money found in the safe and counterfeit bank notes was confiscated.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Key summary </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Dutch theme park Julianatoren intercepted counterfeit vouchers on e-commerce platform Marktplaats.nl and brought the case before the District Court in Arhem. The Court found the counterfeiter liable for copyright infringement and awarded reputational damages to the plaintiff.</strong></p>



<p>Key facts of the case:</p>



<ul><li>The Court held that the defendant had deceived consumers by selling invalid homemade vouchers</li><li>The Court also held that the defendant infringed upon the copyrights related to the original design of the Julianatoren voucher</li><li>The Court ordered the defendant to pay reputational damages of €2,000 to the plaintiff, along with further fees and damages</li><li>This decision is significant because almost all claims for reputational damages are denied in the Netherlands</li></ul>



<p>Read full analysis of the case below by Gie van den Broek, Attorney at Netherlands-based law firm LXA.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Introduction</h2>



<p>Theme park Julianatoren in Apeldoorn, Netherlands, offers family vouchers for visitors which are valid for one year. In 2019 the price for a voucher was €237.</p>



<p>In 2018, Julianatoren noticed that low priced non-genuine vouchers were offered for sale on e-commerce marketplace Marktplaats.nl. An investigation revealed the identity of the individual behind the non-genuine vouchers and Theme Park Julianatoren initiated proceedings on the merits.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Decision from District Court in Arhem</h2>



<p>In November 2021, the District Court in Arnhem rendered its decision, with potentially very significant ramifications<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>



<p>The District Court held that the defendant had not only acted wrongfully towards the consumer by selling invalid homemade vouchers but also had infringed upon the copyrights related to the original design of the Julianatoren voucher which they had copied.</p>



<p>The District Court awarded all claims, including reputational damages of €2,000. This decision is particularly interesting because, while the Dutch legal framework enables IP-owners to claim reputational damages, in practice almost all claims for reputational damages are denied.</p>



<p>The District Court also ruled that public buying on Marktplaats.nl may be expected to be cautious.</p>



<p>Although Julianatoren suffered damage, this does not mean that Julianatoren was obliged to fully compensate the affected buyers of counterfeited vouchers.</p>



<p>The District Court ruled under point 5.13. that it is a well-known fact that buying a voucher/entrance ticket/ticket on marktplaats.nl for a considerably lower amount (in this case sometimes even for € 100.00 and thus 40% less) than the actual value there is a risk that such a voucher is counterfeit. It is very conceivable that Julianatoren wanted to meet the buyers of the counterfeited vouchers, not to disappoint them (and especially the children) and to prevent its good name and reputation (also via social media) being affected.</p>



<p>However, Julianatoren could also have chosen to offer the buyers of the counterfeit vouchers one (or two) day ticket(s) or to reimburse the amount paid for the counterfeit voucher. The District Court is therefore of the opinion that an amount of €150.00 per false voucher can be awarded, which means that an amount of 50 x € 150.00 = € 7,500.00 will be awarded on this point.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-ramifications">Ramifications</h2>



<p>The rollercoaster came to a full stop. Two important usable insights the District Court decided in the verdict. 1) reputational damages can under certain circumstances be calculated by expressing a percentage (i.c. 0.002 %) on the marketing budget of the IP right owner, and 2) consumers on Marktplaats.nl have to bear in mind that when the price seems too good to be true it probably is.</p>



<p>Although the decision came from a lower court, it may pave the way for future victims of IP infringement to successfully claim reputation damages in the Netherlands.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Key summary </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Gie van den Broek, Attorney at LXA, analyzes a commercial dispute between two Rotterdam-based companies that produce erotic products. </strong></p>



<p>The Defendant in this case previously had an agreement with the plaintiff to manufacture a whip and subsequently decided to source these from another company. The Plaintiff alleged that they designed the original whip and therefore continued manufacture of this product amounted to intellectual property infringement.</p>



<p>The Court of Rotterdam ruled that the conditions of Article 6 of the Dutch Copyright Act (DCA) were not met and required the defendant to:</p>



<ul><li>Stop the infringements with immediate effect;</li><li>Account for the numbers of purchased and sold infringing products, and the purchase and sales prices;</li><li>Carry out a recall action with a mandatory wording;</li><li>Destroy the infringing products;</li></ul>



<p>Learn more about the case and see the full Court ruling below.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Facts of the case</h2>



<p>Plaintiff is a Rotterdam company (wholesale and retail) specialized in erotic products such as whips. The Defendant is O-Products B.V, a wholesaler of erotic products. In the past, the defendant had ordered the Plaintiff to have a certain whip manufactured, and subsequently decided to source these from another company. The Plaintiff claimed that they originally designed the whip and alleged therefore that the manufacture of this product by another party was unauthorized and amounted to intellectual property infringement.</p>



<p>The judge was asked to form an opinion in particular on the handle of the whips. The following questions were asked:</p>



<p>(1) is the handle of Plaintiff&#8217;s whips a work within the meaning of the Copyright Act?</p>



<p>(2) if that answer is in the affirmative, who should be considered the maker?</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Legal framework</h2>



<p>Article 6 of the Dutch Copyright Act (DCA) provides that if a work has been created according to a design by another person and under his direction and supervision, this person is regarded as the maker of that work.</p>



<p>The judge ruled that the handle of the whip has its own original character and bears the personal stamp of the maker and is therefore a work that is protected by copyright. Plaintiff is the maker, because she had already designed the products before the parties came into contact with each other. Subsequently, the defendant submitted the defense that this was a design commissioned by the defendant, based on the abovementioned article 6 DCA, and that on that basis the copyright rests with him. O-Products had not sufficiently demonstrated at the Court hearing what his design consisted of.</p>



<p>At the hearing, the Plaintiff also pointed to the fact that it already had a variant of the basic model. The further arguments from the defendant about the design originating from her was, in the opinion of the court, wholly insufficient to be able to speak of a design. The Court ruled that it concerned only a few minor adjustments to the original model. The correspondence with the Plaintiff submitted by the Defendant did not elicit a design, nor did it indicate management and supervision on the part of the Defendant.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-the-court-of-rotterdam-ruling">The Court of Rotterdam Ruling</h2>



<p>The Court ruled that the conditions of Article 6 DCA were not met and required O-products to:</p>



<ul><li>Stop the infringements with immediate effect;</li><li>Account for the numbers of purchased and sold infringing products, and the purchase and sales prices, subject to submission of purchase and sales invoices;</li><li>Carry out a recall action with a mandatory wording to be adopted as dictated by the court;</li><li>Destroy the infringing products (or have them destroyed) at its own expense under bailiff supervision;</li></ul>



<p>The foregoing by order of a penalty of € 1,000 for each day or part of a day that O-Products fails to comply with these orders in whole or in part or – at the discretion of the claimant, with a maximum of € 30,000;</p>



<ul><li>O-Products is liable for damage suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the infringement of its copyright and orders O-Products to pay compensation for this, to be drawn up at the state</li><li>O-Products is ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings, estimated on the part of the plaintiff at €8,491.98.</li></ul>

<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-key-summary">Key summary </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Even as a &#8220;neutral intermediary provider&#8221; Facebook is ordered to do more to ban advertisements for counterfeit products from its platform.</strong></p>



<ul><li>In its recent verdict as initiated by PVH, the court of The Hague (specialized in matters on intellectual property) took the view that Facebook did not directly infringe the copyrights and trademark rights of PVH, and may benefit from the exemption as laid down in Article 14(1) of the Directive on electronic commerce in respect of all liability. </li><li>Nonetheless, the circumstances of the case at hand could not reasonably prevent Facebook from providing certain personal data of its users to PVH. </li><li>Facebook was ordered to take additional measures to both end and prevent infringement committed on its platform.</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-pvh-and-facebook">PVH and Facebook</h2>



<p>Recently, the court of The Hague has published its verdict in the ongoing matter between Tommy Hilfiger (PVH) and Facebook on the many advertisements for fake Tommy Hilfiger clothing regularly posted on both Facebook and Instagram. This recent verdict concerns the precise scope of the obligation to filter (infringing) advertisements prior to their placement and the obligation of Facebook to provide PVH with the personal data of its relevant advertisers.</p>



<p>PVH Europe is a large fashion company and exploits several well-known brands, such as Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Through various licensing structures Tommy Hilfiger Europe markets clothing articles of the Tommy Hilfiger brand within the European Union. To this end, it also uses the advertising options of Facebook’s platforms. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook operates a global social media platform and offers its users the possibility of placing various types of advertisements on both Facebook and Instagram for a fee. For example, a Facebook user may place an advertisement for products he wishes to sell, both professional and personal. To support its user in that regard, Facebook offers a service in which it automatically (re)targets the relevant public, and automatically promotes the most relevant items of the advertiser anywhere on its platform.</p>



<p>On a regular basis, the advertisements show and promote counterfeit products. These advertisements often lead to websites offering counterfeit Tommy Hilfiger products and scamming consumers in the end, i.e. by committing credit card fraud. Facebook therefore conducts a preventive screening of the advertisements prior to their placement on its platforms to detect listings which might contain infringing products. Unfortunately, this screening is not sufficiently dissuasive, thereby causing several advertisements for counterfeit Tommy Hilfiger clothing to slip through the net.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-two-preliminary-relief-proceedings">Two preliminary relief proceedings</h2>



<p>Although Facebook claimed it always acted expeditiously to remove the respective advertisements as soon as PVH made Facebook aware of it, Facebook – according to PVH – took insufficient measures to actually prevent the infringements as such.</p>



<p>In that context, PVH brought&nbsp;<a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:9362">preliminary relief proceedings</a>&nbsp;before the court of Amsterdam at the end of 2018, in which Facebook was ordered by the preliminary relief judge to take more adequate measures to actually prevent the offer for sale of counterfeit products via its online platforms. Even though Facebook was regarded as an intermediary whose conduct did not infringe the relevant trademark rights of PVH itself, it was decided that Facebook could be held liable for taking insufficient measures to prevent any future infringements of a trademark by reason of a wrongful act. Facebook was ordered to implement policies and put in place several controls to detect specific listings meeting certain characteristics (such as a too low price, high discounts, poor English in the description, etc.) and to subsequently remove such advertisements from its platform, as these advertisements were likely to promote counterfeit products or were allegedly placed by “bad actors” promoting their fraudulent websites. Facebook was also ordered to provide personal or other identifying information from the respective advertising accounts. Whereas Facebook initially argued that on the basis of the Directive on electronic commerce it must be exempt from liability for information (and thus advertisements) stored and placed on its platform by its users, the judge disallowed this defence. The appeal lodged against this verdict is still pending.</p>



<p>Pending this appeal, PVH has enforced the judgment at hand and thereby ordered Facebook to implement the respective policies and to provide PVH with all relevant data relating to the (infringing) advertisements as reported by PVH. This conduct ultimately led to an&nbsp;<a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2019:3207">enforcement dispute</a>&nbsp;before the court of Amsterdam. The judge eventually took the view that Facebook had failed to timely submit to PVH i.a. the city information of four advertisers and has therefore forfeited a penalty of € 730,000.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-most-recent-judgment">Most recent judgment</h2>



<p>Following the preliminary relief proceedings in 2018, PVH had initiated&nbsp;<a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2021:2422">substantive proceedings</a>&nbsp;before the court of The Hague, arguing the case all over again. Where PVH again argued that Facebook had infringed PVH’s copyrights and trademarks by communicating copyright protected works to the public, the judge in these main proceedings also took the view that Facebook must be considered to be an intermediary in this context and therefore did not carry out an act of communication itself by merely allowing and enabling the public to access the protected works. According to the judge, Facebook thus does not infringe the copyrights of PVH. The same goes for the alleged infringement of PVH’s trademark rights: Facebook is to be considered an advertising platform and service giving its users the means to make use of trademarks without the authorisation of their proprietors. That use is thus made by the user of the advertising platform, whereas Facebook simply allows its users to use such signs on its platform. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition hereto, and contrary to the view of the preliminary relief judge, the court of The Hague held that Facebook was in fact able to benefit from the exemption laid down in Article 14(1) of the Directive on electronic commerce in respect of all liability that may result from the information as stored on its platform at the request of its users as Facebook had not played an active role in relation to the advertisements at issue, despite i.a. its active efforts to micro target the relevant public on behalf of the advertiser. Facebook could thus not be held liable for the infringing content as stored on its platform . In the end, however, the court held that the circumstances of the case could not reasonably prevent Facebook from providing certain personal data of its users to PVH if and when reporting infringing content. As PVH has sufficiently demonstrated this data will be necessary to pursue a legitimate interest (e.g. to put a stop to the infringement itself), the court considered the transfer of data to be lawful under the GDPR.</p>



<p>Whereas the court stated that Facebook had already taken several measures to prevent misuse of its platform (which are 99 % effective), Facebook is now ordered to take additional measures to both end and prevent infringements committed on its platform, as this possibility of requiring the termination or prevention of any infringement is not in any way affected by the limitation of the liability of Facebook as established in the Directive of electronic ecommerce. However, as the obligation to filter information stored at the request of the advertiser as ordered in the preliminary relief proceedings (whereby the filter must be based on i.e. the pricing, high discounts, or poor English in the description) could not be carried out by automated tools and technologies, Facebook would be obliged to actively seek for infringing content manually. As Facebook has more than 7 million active advertisers, any obligation of such nature to undertake filtering in order to seek any infringement would not be appropriate, practicable or proportionate in any way, and would not strike a fair balance between the protection of the intellectual property right enjoyed by PVH and the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by service providers such as Facebook. In addition, there will be more trade mark proprietors obliging Facebook to adopt the same measures for protecting their respective trade mark rights. The court has therefore ordered Facebook to undertake filtering of the advertisements on its platform by means of an automatic filtering tool.</p>



<p>In the end, Facebook is i.a. ordered by the court to cease and desist from providing services as an intermediary for the infringement of PVH’s copyrights and trademark rights in the Netherlands and the Benelux by advertisements or promotional accounts identical to the examples as specified in the course of the proceedings. In addition thereto, Facebook is ordered to provide PVH with a list of specific data relating to the advertisements or promotional accounts at stake, and to ultimately terminate the advertising agreements with the advertisers and users who have placed such infringing advertisements and/or created such infringing promotional accounts. An important caveat of these orders is that Facebook may indicate, within two weeks after receipt of a written notification of PVH, that it does not consider itself obliged to provide the information at stake or that the persons involved has (legitimately) objected thereto. Moreover, Facebook shall forfeit a penalty in the amount of € 5,000 for each day that it does not comply with the orders of the court, until the maximum amount of € 2,000,000 has been reached.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>



<p>According to the court of The Hague, Facebook may rely on the exemption from liability provided for intermediary providers, as Facebook is held not to play an active role in relation to the content and advertisements stored and placed by its users. This means that Facebook shall also not be required to pay damages to PVH. The fact that Facebook generates considerable advertising revenues from its advertising platform (and thus from the respective infringing advertisements), does not in itself detract from this.</p>



<p>This exemption from liability however does not relieve Facebook of its obligations to prevent and remove infringing content from its platform. In that context, Facebook is obliged to enable the respective proprietor to take appropriate action against the infringing party itself, i.e. by providing personal data of the latter. In addition, Facebook must strengthen its screening efforts prior to the placing of the advertisements. In that context and notwithstanding the exemption of liability of Facebook, the court of The Hague has based its injunction on the stipulation of Article 6:196c(5) of the Dutch Civil Code and Article 14(3) of the Directive on electronic commerce, on the basis of which it was entitled to require Facebook to terminate or prevent an infringement by imposing a screening obligation, to ultimately draw the right balance with the legitimate interests of the PVH regardless.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-key-summary">Key summary</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Original Beauty Technology Company Limited (owner of the House of CB and Mistress Rocks brands) successfully enforced both unregistered UK and EU design rights in respect of 7 of competitor G4K Fashion Ltd’s bodycon and bandage dresses.</strong></p>



<p>The judgment demonstrates that unregistered design right protection can be a powerful tool for brand owners operating in sectors with high product turnover, such as online fashion retail. However, the need to demonstrate copying for there to be infringement of these rights (unlike registered design rights) can also pose a challenge.</p>



<p>OBTC was able to rely upon the defendant’s own design records to demonstrate that certain of its products had been copied in order to create the defendant’s garments. Such evidence may not be available in all cases and the English court may be prepared to <em>infer </em>that copying has occurred where it can be shown that a defendant had access to the claimant’s design and the similarities between the products themselves suggest copying. However, the Court was not prepared to make such inferences in this case, even where evidence of copying of other garments had been demonstrated.</p>



<p>This case demonstrates the value of unregistered UK and EU design rights to brand owners, but also underlines the additional benefit that maybe offered by registered rights at the enforcement stage.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-introduction">Introduction</h2>



<p>Original Beauty Technology Company Ltd (OBTC) sells bodycon and bandage dresses under the main brand “House of CB” with a sister brand “Mistress Rocks”.</p>



<p>OBTC sued G4K Fashion Ltd, who also sell bodycon and bandage dresses online, for infringement of unregistered design rights under UK and EU law in respect of 91 of their “Oh Polly” branded dresses (albeit the claim was limited to 20 dresses only by the time the case came to trial). OBTC also claimed that G4K had copied its business model, social media, marketing, packaging and presentation, such that consumers would be deceived into thinking that Oh Polly was a sister brand to House of CB, so as to amount to passing off.</p>



<p>G4K’s main designer was Ms Claire Henderson (also the second defendant). Her evidence was that she designed by looking at trends from images she had collected, designed the details of each garment in her head, and then looked for images of existing garments that she could use to show the factory what it was she wanted made.</p>



<p>However, there was no evidence to corroborate Ms Henderson’s version of her design process. Instead, the evidence showed that in each case, Ms Henderson had identified at least one garment (being either an OBTC garment or a third party garment), an image of which she emailed to colleagues or otherwise provided directly to the factory to be made up.</p>



<p>G4K also used a software program called “Trello”, which tracked the development of a garment from design through to the end of manufacture. The evidence included images uploaded to Trello by Ms Henderson, including images of OBTC’s garments.<a></a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-decision">Decision</h2>



<p>Mr David Stone QC, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, considered Ms Henderson’s version of her design process to be a fabrication, concocted to get around the very real difficulty that she had in fact taken images of OBTC’s garments (and third party garments) and sent them to the factory to be made up.</p>



<h3 id="h-uk-unregistered-design-right-ukudr">UK Unregistered Design Right (UKUDR)</h3>



<p>Mr Stone found that OBTC owned the UKUDR in the garments in question.</p>



<p>G4K admitted that an OBTC dress was referred to in the design process of nine of the 20 G4K garments in issue. As for the other eleven designs, OBTC argued that the judge should infer copying on the balance of probabilities because of: (i) the similarities between the designs, which suggested that copying had taken place; (ii) Ms Henderson’s approach to design; (iii) the incomplete nature of the Trello records and the likelihood that Ms Henderson passed images directly to the manufacturers; and (iv) the likelihood that the OBTC garment alleged to have been copied existed in Ms Henderson’s archive of images.</p>



<p>However, Mr Stone said that, absent striking similarities between the designs in relation to features that were not themselves well known, he did not think that reasons (ii) to (iv) were sufficient to prove copying, or to give rise to a presumption that G4K was required to rebut. The UKUDR claim in respect of these dresses therefore failed.</p>



<h3 id="h-community-unregistered-design-right-cudr">Community Unregistered Design Right (CUDR)</h3>



<p>Applying the test set out in <em>Cantel Medical (UK) Ltd v ARC Medical Design Ltd </em>[2018] EWHC 345 (Pat), the judge found that: (i) the sector here was women’s clothing; (ii) the informed user was a user of women’s clothing, who was aware of bodycon and bandage dress fashions, including garments worn by celebrities and shown on social media, and would compare the designs directly; (iii) a garment had to be designed to be worn and to fit the body, but within those constraints, the designer had almost complete design freedom; (iv) it was not contended that any feature of any of the designs was solely dictated by technical function; and (v) some aspects of a garment, i.e. the front, would strike the informed user as more important; differences on the back of the garment would be noticed, but they would not be given the importance of the front of the garment.</p>



<p>As for ownership, Mr Stone found, again, that OBTC was the owner. He also came to the same conclusions on copying as in relation to UKUDR.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-infringement">Infringement</h2>



<p>Mr Stone found that seven of the nine garments in which G4K admitted referencing the OBTC design and uploading it to Trello at the beginning of the design process infringed OBTC’s UKUDR and CUDR in the garment design.</p>



<p>By way of example<a>:</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img width="383" height="220" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dresses.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15642" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dresses.png 383w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dresses-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><figcaption>From left to right: OBTC dress and G4K dress</figcaption></figure>



<p>The OBTC dress above was designed by an OBTC designer and first displayed on social media accounts in January 2018. Ms Henderson saw the dress on YouTube and took a screen shot, which she saved to her laptop. She then sent email instructions to her brother, who was also involved in the business, attaching images of the OBTC dress, together with a third party dress. Mr Henderson used software to remove the buckle shown on the OBTC image, uploaded it to Trello and sent the image to G4K’s manufacturers to be made up, all in accordance with Ms Henderson’s instructions. The G4K dress was first offered for sale on the Oh Polly website in March 2018.</p>



<p>G4K relied on the dress shown below, which was designed by Cushnie et Ochs (shown here worn by Karlie Kloss in an image taken from <em>The Daily Mail Online</em> in June 2016), to try and prove that the OBTC dress was not original in a copyright sense under UKUDR:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-thumbnail clear-bottom"><img width="71" height="150" src="https://mk0incoprorqrlirgki5.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/G4K-dress-2-71x150.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15661"/></figure>



<p>G4K also relied on a further six dresses to try and prove that the OBTC dress was commonplace.</p>



<p>In Mr Stone’s view, the OBTC dress was not slavishly copied from the Cushnie et Ochs dress and did not produce the same overall impression on the informed user. As for the other six dresses, Mr Stone found that they were all different designs and did not make the OBTC design commonplace. Accordingly, the design right in the OBTC dress was not invalid in relation to UKUDR and CUDR.</p>



<p>Mr Stone had no hesitation in finding that the G4K dress was copied from the OBTC dress. As was clear from the evidence, Ms Henderson had downloaded an image of the OBTC dress from YouTube and instructed that it be sent to the factory to be reproduced.</p>



<p>On a detailed side-by-side analysis of the dresses themselves, Mr Stone found that none of the differences between the designs, individually or collectively, was sufficient to render the G4K dress other than an article made substantially to the design of the OBTC dress. Similarly, the differences did not strike the informed user so as to produce a different overall impression. The G4K dress therefore infringed both the UKUDR and CUDR in the OBTC dress.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-passing-off">Passing off</h2>



<p>OBTC claimed that, by copying many of the aspects of its business, G4K had misrepresented to the public that Oh Polly was a sister brand of House of CB. That misrepresentation had caused and was causing OBTC damage.</p>



<p>Mr Stone found that OBTC had proved its case in relation to goodwill in some of the indicia of its business, for example the designs, use of models, locations, GIFs and Instagram presentation, but not such that sufficient members of the relevant public had been deceived. Therefore, the first element of <em>Jif Lemon</em> had been made out (goodwill), but not the second (misrepresentation). The passing off case therefore failed.</p>



<p>Mr Stone reached this conclusion <em>“with some reluctance”</em>. In Mr Stone’s view, G4K had been able to ride on the coat tails of OBTC’s successful business model, and rather than investing in its own development, or spending money and time trialling different models, styles, locations, packaging etc, it had obtained an advantage by copying a successful competitor. However, as Jacob LJ said in <em>L’Oréal v Bellure </em>[2007] EWCA Civ 968, passing off is not a tort of unfair competition. Passing off requires a misrepresentation, and there was insufficient evidence to find that consumers did or would consider House of CB and Oh Polly to be sister brands. That was OBTC’s case, and it had not been made out.</p>
