<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-are-they"><strong>What are they?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s start with defining the key terminology. <strong>Parallel Imports </strong>are genuine goods that have been made available on the market by the rights holder or with the rights holder’s consent, that have later been imported into another market without the rightsholder’s consent.</p>



<p>So, what are <strong>Grey Goods</strong>? <strong>“Parallel import”</strong> is the legal term for the issue while <strong>“Grey Goods&#8221;</strong>(or &#8220;Grey Market Goods&#8221;) is the common business term used to describe the actual products that are imported.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>Grey market goods can pose an array of risks to brand owners</strong>:</p>



<h3 id="h-1-loss-of-revenue">1. Loss of <strong>Revenue</strong></h3>



<p>The most obvious one might be the risk to revenue as parallel imports can impact competition and profitability.</p>



<p>If grey goods are priced below the recommended retail price in a specific territory, the grey goods will undermine the brand’s pricing strategy and compete with the official sales in that region. This will then reduce profitability and will have an impact on the overall “global” profitability of the brand.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h3 id="h-2-licensing-agreements-put-at-risk">2. <strong><strong>Licensing Agreements</strong></strong> Put at Risk</h3>



<p>Revenue could also be at risk from a licensing or authorized seller perspective. A licensing agreement will only be valuable to licensees if the advantages associated with being authorized outweighs the size of the licensing fee. That balance is at risk if importers of grey goods are allowed to compete with the licensees without having to pay the licensing fee in that market.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-reputational-damage">3. <strong><strong><strong><strong>Reputation</strong></strong></strong></strong>al Damage</h3>



<p>There are also some reputational risks that come with the presence of grey goods, for example: potential poor service and support for consumers, warranties not applying as consumers are expecting them to, or incorrect packaging and product information for the market.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-consumer-harm">4. <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Consumer Harm</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>



<p>In some cases, grey goods can even pose a risk of actual harm to the consumer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can range from things like non-prescription drugs that do not come with instructions in the local language – if that happens, then there is a risk that the consumer uses it incorrectly and suffers a health risk as a result.</p>



<p>Another example would be products that need to be powered through an electrical cord &#8211; if the voltage restrictions are not correct for the territory where it’s being sold, the product might pose a serious safety risk.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded"><strong>Solving the problem</strong></h2>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="1422" height="800" src="https://mk0incoprorqrlirgki5.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Parallel-Imports_Slide-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11584" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Parallel-Imports_Slide-3.png 1422w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Parallel-Imports_Slide-3-300x169.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Parallel-Imports_Slide-3-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Parallel-Imports_Slide-3-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1422px) 100vw, 1422px" /></figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>There are four key components to tackling parallel imports: </strong></p>



<h3 id="h-1-establish-origin-of-grey-goods">1. Establish Origin of Grey Goods</h3>



<p>When it comes to solving the problem, you need to firstly understand the issue, starting with the origin of the goods.</p>



<p>You can use technological solutions to collect information. By scraping key seller information, you’ll be in a better position to gauge the scope of the issue, and <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/whiteboard/image-capabilities/">Optical Character Recognition</a> can be used to pick out valuable information from images.</p>



<p>There are also investigative measures that can be taken, like test purchases, open-source intelligence investigations and combining datasets to pinpoint the origin of the goods.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h3 id="h-2-determine-territories-affected-and-size-of-issue">2. Determine Territories Affected and Size of Issue</h3>



<p>Information should also be collected to determine which domains and online marketplaces that sellers are using, how many listings that have been posted, and what the stock levels are like. Don’t forget to also cover social media since some sellers will market themselves on social media even if the sale is completed elsewhere.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-optimize-your-supply-chain">3. Optimize your Supply Chain</h3>



<p>Once the scope and character of the issue has been determined it’s time to start considering remedies for it.</p>



<p>Firstly, look at how you can optimize the supply chain. The shorter a distribution chain is, the easier it is to control it, so therefore, there should be no unnecessary middlemen.</p>



<p>Check and reassess your contracts &#8211; you should clearly outline the rules that official distributors have to abide by (including clear geographical limits), and make sure that breaches of the terms are linked to damages.</p>



<p>The incentives to move goods can also be decreased by harmonizing prices – it might not be possible to completely harmonize, but the smaller the price difference is, the lower the incentive for parallel importers.</p>



<p>Finally, you might want to make your products traceable, for example through serial numbers or different packages in different regions.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-bear-down-on-parallel-import-supply-though-enforcement">4. Bear Down on Parallel Import Supply though Enforcement</h3>



<p>Even if a brand has taken all necessary and appropriate measures in relation to their distribution channels, they might still have a grey goods market that needs tackling.</p>



<p>Enforcement based on parallel importation is indeed challenging and often time consuming. However, there are tools that brands can benefit from when trying to get grey goods listings offline:</p>



<ul><li>If the seller is using copyright protected images, a copyright claim can be made.</li><li>If the products do not adhere to local regulations, the listing can be enforced based on a regulatory claim.</li><li>And finally, there might be a platform policy that forbids parallel imported goods on the platform that can be used.</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-growth-oppportunity"><strong>Growth Opp</strong>portuni<strong>ty</strong></h2>



<p>Tackling Parallel Imports can present a growth opportunity for your business. </p>



<p>If the data is telling you that there is a big grey market in a region where you do not currently have any official retailers, that is probably an opportunity for growth.</p>



<p>Another way of seizing opportunities for growth is to reach out to parallel importers and offer them a contract as an official retailer. Several Incopro customers have  used this approach, turning unauthorized players into authorized agents.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>

<p>An edited version of the Whiteboard transcript can be found below.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-text-and-keyword-searching-are-necessary-but-not-sufficient-alone"><strong>Text and keyword searching are necessary but not sufficient alone</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A Brand Protection program will be&nbsp;using text and keyword searches to build a&nbsp;base&nbsp;profile of the threats&nbsp;out there, but this is no longer enough as bad actors have evolved their behaviors.</li><li>Images need to be used as a data source in their own right, to aid the discovery and&nbsp;prioritization&nbsp;of infringements.</li><li>Typically,&nbsp;we now see a lot&nbsp;bad actors not using text in their listings and posts but instead images – this is&nbsp;especially&nbsp;the case for advanced bad actors. For example, in a recent&nbsp;account&nbsp;over half of the high-risk items identified came from&nbsp;the imaging capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left heading-branded"><strong>The Power of Three</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>In addition to image matching/searching, a&nbsp;comprehensive image-based program will include three main&nbsp;areas:&nbsp;Logo Detection, Similarity Matching, and OCR.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Image matching/searching&nbsp;look for exact copies&nbsp;of, or closely similar images&nbsp;to those&nbsp;that belong to the brand.</li><li>This capability ensures that infringements that do not contain brand related keywords are still collected and&nbsp;prioritized&nbsp;by Talisman, Incopro&#8217;s Brand Protection platform &#8211; for instance, use of copyright images.</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-logo-detection"><strong>Logo Detection&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Logo&nbsp;detection&nbsp;goes one step further, and&nbsp;uses machine learning based image classification, to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;the use of logos within an image.&nbsp;</li><li>Can find logo in an image even if the logo is&nbsp;purposely&nbsp;distorted or adjusted&nbsp;to avoid detection.</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-similarity-matching"><strong>Similarity&nbsp;Matching&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Our similar matching&nbsp;capability&nbsp;identifies&nbsp;lookalike&nbsp;products based on shape,&nbsp;texture,&nbsp;and&nbsp;color,&nbsp;regardless of&nbsp;how the item is described in text, &#8211; and even if the trademark is not mentioned.</li><li>This capability&nbsp;can be used hand in hand with design rights.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-optical-character-recognition-ocr"><strong>Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</strong></h3>



<ul><li>As noted, text&nbsp;searches are&nbsp;always&nbsp;used in Brand Protection programs, but we&nbsp;also&nbsp;supplement&nbsp;them&nbsp;with our Optical Character Recognition (OCR),&nbsp;to&nbsp;discover and collect text that has been embedded in images to evade detection.</li><li>If the text is “within” the image – it will not be captured&nbsp;using&nbsp;standard keyword searching – we use OCR technology to&nbsp;pull out and process the text&nbsp;within&nbsp;the image and integrate with our prioritization tools.</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Logo Detection Example</h2>

</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>This technology uses machine learning to identify the use of the brand’s logo within an image, even where the seller only uses generic words to describe the item that is being sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This face mask listing is an example, where the product is generically described as ‘designer inspired face masks’,&nbsp;but Logo Detection is able to&nbsp;identify the use of the brand’s logo on the product itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The red flag:&nbsp;the seller is being evasive in not mentioning the brand name by text, as that would have been easily detected, which points to their activity being illegitimate.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h2 class="heading-branded"><strong>Similarity Matching</strong> Example</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns mb-0">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>Similarity Matching is crucial&nbsp;for identifying copycat items that imitate the design of a product but&nbsp;do not mention the trademark&nbsp;in text,&nbsp;or use the exact same logo as the brand.</strong></p>



<p>The example above shows a listing that copies&nbsp;the design of a well-known&nbsp;brand of sandals. Even though the listing does not mention the brand name &#8211; and has altered the logo on the product &#8211; similarity matching&nbsp;prioritized&nbsp;the listing based on&nbsp;images of the official product,&nbsp;with similarities in the shape.</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>Bad actors will embed text within images to avoid keyword detection. One of the ways in which bad actors try to evade enforcement, is by&nbsp;disguising&nbsp;the&nbsp;price&nbsp;in a listing&nbsp;to make it look legitimate.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In the example listing of replica luxury watches above,&nbsp;the seller uses prices&nbsp;in the standard layout&nbsp;that on the surface look legitimate.&nbsp;However, the true price is stated in the text embedded within the image &#8211; which is much lower &#8211; together with contact details&nbsp;for buyers to get in touch and carry out the transaction outside the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A very low price is often a key signal for a counterfeit&nbsp;good&nbsp;– in this example that price signal&nbsp;was hidden with the image but detected using OCR.</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" id="h-this-example-is-even-more-evasive-and-avoids-mentioning-the-price-completely" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>This&nbsp;example&nbsp;of a listing for a &#8216;branded diamond ring&#8217; is even more evasive and disguises the true price even further.</strong></p>



<p>Rather than&nbsp;mentioning&nbsp;the true price, the seller states&nbsp;in Chinese&nbsp;at the top of the image that the buyer is to disregard the first 2 digits of the listing price. By showing a falsely high price, the seller is attempting to avoid tools that prioritize risk based on the listing price. They then also provide their WeChat ID at the bottom for buyers to enquire prices and browse&nbsp;the full product range.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/advanced-image-capabilities/">Talisman’s Advanced Image Capabilities</a> enable these infringements to be&nbsp;discovered and&nbsp;prioritized&nbsp;automatically.

<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-bad-actor-networks-what-are-they"><strong>Bad Actor Networks &#8211; what </strong>are they?</h2>



<p>Bad actors that are&nbsp;abusing your brands operate much as you do.&nbsp;They use websites, social media, and marketplace listings to reach consumers and operate&nbsp;this as a multi-channel business in the same way that a legitimate business operates.&nbsp;The&nbsp;distinction is that they do not have to play by the rules and can move and shift their businesses quickly across the online space.</p>



<p>You may not be&nbsp;aware of the vast range&nbsp;of “Bad Actor Networks” operating out there impacting&nbsp;your&nbsp;brand.&nbsp;These networks are behind all the counterfeit listings,&nbsp;seller accounts, impersonation on&nbsp;social media, and&nbsp;knock&nbsp;off&nbsp;websites&nbsp;that you have to deal with every&nbsp;day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, they&nbsp;aren’t&nbsp;all large&nbsp;and complex&nbsp;networks, there are also lots&nbsp;of smaller networks&nbsp;too. It&#8217;s therefore vital that you can understand what you’re dealing with and formulate an informed strategy to tackle them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left heading-branded"><strong>What is Network Analysis?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="1422" height="800" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis-SLIDE-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10876" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis-SLIDE-2.png 1422w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis-SLIDE-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis-SLIDE-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis-SLIDE-2-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1422px) 100vw, 1422px" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>Network Analysis discovers, connects, and prioritizes Bad Actor Networks targeting your brands.</strong></p>



<p>Network Analysis is the method used to&nbsp;construct,&nbsp;understand&nbsp;and investigate the relationship between&nbsp;bad actors, their online channels and their offline activity.&nbsp; </p>



<p>By applying this method to the data&nbsp;collected about the threats to your brand, you can reveal&nbsp;how the Bad Actor Networks operate. You can then pinpoint their weaknesses&nbsp;to disrupt them or ensure you know as much about them as possible in order to completely dismantle&nbsp;them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded"><strong>Why does Network Analysis matter?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="1422" height="800" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis_Slide-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10882" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis_Slide-3.png 1422w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis_Slide-3-300x169.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis_Slide-3-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incopro-Whiteboard-Tutorial_-Network-Analysis_Slide-3-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1422px) 100vw, 1422px" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>Use Network Analysis to understand both the wider threat landscape and what poses the greatest risk to your brands and consumers.</strong></p>



<p>The traditional approach to brand protection has been to target listings,&nbsp;posts&nbsp;and individual websites.&nbsp;Historically, brands have tackled these one at a time unaware of how they fit into the wider landscape online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s likely that&nbsp;you’ve been overwhelmed with hundreds, if not thousands of listings and posts, that reappear not long after you have taken then offline.&nbsp;This ‘data dump’, which relies on you and your team sifting through&nbsp;rows of information, is simply too much to help you understand how to tackle the problem in the most effective way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By&nbsp;focusing&nbsp;on the way that bad actors use multiple channels to get to consumers, you can start to understand the best way to disrupt their routes to market.</p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>Network Analysis enables you to make the best use of resources to impact these networks and protect your brands.</strong></p>



<p>Teams tasked with protecting their brands never have enough time,&nbsp;money&nbsp;or people to tackle every problem out there.&nbsp;Given these constraints, you need to be able to make good decisions about how you tackle these networks both online and offline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many brands will look to Network Analysis as a way to connect both online and offline, as they know that offline cases can&nbsp;be lengthy and expensive.&nbsp;Tying together both online and offline intelligence to decide how to tackle these networks as quickly as possible and with&nbsp;efficient spend of money and time is critical.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded"><strong>What do you need?</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>1. Data</strong> – &nbsp;You&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;collect, evaluate and&nbsp;collate data.&nbsp; This might be data that you collect about threats online, through searching&nbsp;the web regularly scanning for threats, but it might also be your offline data, gathered as part of your investigations into bad actors.&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenge to overcome here is the scale of the data you might be dealing with.&nbsp; The more threats that you face, the bigger the challenge.&nbsp; That’s where our second essential point comes in….&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul start="2"><li><strong>2. Technology&nbsp;</strong>–&nbsp;You’ll need to leverage technology to do this kind of data processing at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;not only about gathering the data, but also about making sure it’s relevant, cleaned up and can be linked together and visualized.&nbsp; As they say, a picture paints a thousand&nbsp;words&nbsp;and this is definitely true here.&nbsp; Being able to see the network as a web of relationships, helps to drive your analysis and show where you have intelligence gaps and further&nbsp;investigation to do.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul start="3"><li><strong>3. People </strong>– or more specifically, expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology and data can get you so far in understanding what you’re dealing with but inevitably you will need online and offline experts to help you&nbsp;discover more intelligence, gather evidence and tackle the network as it evolves&nbsp;in response to your actions&nbsp;and&nbsp;is hopefully dismantled and destroyed.&nbsp; This expertise can help you to understand who to target&nbsp;and&nbsp;where to enforce&nbsp;to get the result you want.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">What are the applications of Network Analysis?</h2>



<p>Without Network Analysis,&nbsp;your team will be looking at a mass of data about what’s happening to your brand without any indication as to how these accounts relate to each&nbsp;other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we used Network Analysis to understand this data, then we would see these networks before we started enforcement and could decide&nbsp;on the&nbsp;tactics&nbsp;we want to use to remove it.&nbsp;The best option would be to take down all 3 domains plus the&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;page in one go.&nbsp;This is not only efficient as we won’t play whack-a-mole with the various sites and social media&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;but it also has a bigger impact on the bad actor behind this network. Taking down all of their channels at once makes it harder for them to recover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These examples are simplified for the purpose of this tutorial video, but provide a glimpse of the potential&nbsp;applications for Network Analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>



<p>Network Analysis give brands&nbsp;insight&nbsp;into the&nbsp;different&nbsp;networks&nbsp;that are&nbsp;impacting&nbsp;their business&nbsp;and consumers.&nbsp; By laying out these&nbsp;networks&nbsp;and enabling them to be compared&nbsp;with each&nbsp;other, we can&nbsp;drive&nbsp;enforcement&nbsp;and investigations&nbsp;in a more informed&nbsp;and impactful way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brands are empowered to&nbsp;make judgements about where to focus their attention&nbsp;depending on their own specific priorities for their business and consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Network Analysis provides the&nbsp;intelligence vital for brands to be able to have the impact they want&nbsp;when protecting themselves.</p>



<p>If you believe your brand is being exploited by the bad actor networks, consider the right technical and strategic solution for your Brand Protection program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can set up a session with one of our experts to&nbsp;discuss the outcomes you want to achieve&nbsp;for&nbsp;your brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-bad-actor-networks-what-are-they"><strong>Bad Actor Networks &#8211; what </strong>are they?</h2>



<p>&#8220;Whack-a-mole&#8221; is&nbsp;a term that is&nbsp;often&nbsp;used to describe a frustrating Brand Protection practice where for&nbsp;every&nbsp;infringement&nbsp;that is removed another appears. This is due to Bad Actors&nbsp;being&nbsp;persistent and the challenges that can be faced in enforcing against certain online locations&nbsp;&#8211; brand misuse is a profitable business&nbsp;and removing individual listings&nbsp;will not stop the overall operation.</p>



<p>Bad Actors Networks are structured&nbsp;like agile businesses&nbsp;operating via multiple channels to reach more consumers. There is a range of network structures –&nbsp;many are smaller operations, but businesses also face threats from larger sophisticated operations.</p>



<p>Smaller&nbsp;networks often&nbsp;comprise of multiple websites, marketplaces, and social media&nbsp;selling&nbsp;channels, while larger sophisticated operators&nbsp;may&nbsp;have hundreds of channels often also linked to brick and mortar locations or a manufacturer.</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>An example of a common Bad Actor Network: Counterfeiting Network in Turkey – 10 stores operated across 4 Turkish Marketplaces and 2 Global Social Media Platforms. Whole operation linked to 2 Registered Companies in Turkey</strong>.</p>



<ul id="block-b4905880-7c77-4e90-bd8a-f44398824d99"><li>Sellers set up stores on all major e-commerce platforms in the region to maximise their reach. Often operating multiple stores on one&nbsp;platform. Removing some listings from one store will not greatly impact the seller operation where they have multiple stores.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Sellers also use social media to&nbsp;advertise&nbsp;their products and engage with customers. They advertise their&nbsp;products, marketplace&nbsp;stores and contact details. Social media accounts take time to build up and attract followers.&nbsp;</li><li>When only some of their operation and not the whole network is&nbsp;known about, enforcement is not properly targeted.&nbsp;</li><li>In this case the seller network operates registered businesses in Turkey &#8211; this information can also help to bring down the network.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded"><strong>Case study</strong> 2: Large phishing network targeting multiple brands</h2>

<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>An example of a more complex network: 100+ phishing websites detected with 160 brands impersonated by one network</strong>.</p>



<ul id="block-49a5435c-5fad-406b-a8cf-8e8e8f0704f9"><li>Websites are set up&nbsp;to mirror brands official&nbsp;stores offering branded products for sale.&nbsp;By offering discounted brand products, bad actors&nbsp;are collecting personal and payment information from unsuspecting customers. These Websites are also used to spread Malware.&nbsp;Impersonating Social Media accounts and Ads, Search Engine natural searches, Paid Search, and Referrals from other sites are commonly used to divert customers to&nbsp;these&nbsp;fraudulent sites.&nbsp;</li><li>The Websites are hosted with multiple hosting providers and registrars and removing individual websites often will not make an impact on the operation of the infringers. New sites are easy to set up and pop up overnight&nbsp;resulting in little impact for a lot of effort.</li><li>Tackling social media accounts for these bad actors makes much more impact.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded"><strong><strong>How you can tackle Bad Actor Networks and&nbsp;the benefits of taking a strategic approach</strong></strong></h2>



<ul><li>To stop playing a whack-a-mole with bad actors, you need to operate&nbsp;strategically –&nbsp;tackle the&nbsp;weak points in the network, not individual infringements or hard to stop websites.</li><li>Use the latest&nbsp;techniques&nbsp;to drive targeted action –&nbsp;Network Analysis&nbsp;connects the&nbsp;dots between the sellers, drives &nbsp;&nbsp;visibility over the&nbsp;entire&nbsp;network and targets enforcement at the weak points.</li><li>Eliminate the weak points sends the right message to the businesses and operators behind it.</li><li>Collaborate – Group action by Service Providers and Platforms&nbsp;and notify them of the activity observed with the view&nbsp;to&nbsp;banning the network from their platforms to prevent re-offending activity. Consider joining action with other brands infringed by the network for more effective enforcement and to save on legal costs.</li></ul>



<p>By effectively removing Bad Actor Networks,&nbsp;you will see a significant reduction in&nbsp;infringement&nbsp;online, reduction in consumer diversion, and growth of revenue.</p>

<p>An edited version of the Whiteboard transcript can be found below.</p>



<p>Many brands receive complaints from consumers referring to Social Media&nbsp;pages that&nbsp;are not&nbsp;theirs &#8211; relating to fake products, fake competitions, phishing scams and other illegitimate activity. </p>



<p>Your team  may also have had frustrating experiences where you need to access your brand Social Media page to run a marketing campaign or maybe even go to open a store and can’t access the page because the access details have been lost. This typically occurs where employees or agents who set these pages up have now left. You then must open a new page and the old one remains active which can cause confusion and lead to several “dormant” Social Media pages existing. &nbsp;<br><br>Auditing your Social Media presence will give you the information you need to&nbsp;identify risks&nbsp;and by combining this with a brand protection solution you can remove these threats and improve the customers digital&nbsp;experience&nbsp;with your brands via Social Media.</p>



<p>Let us&nbsp;dive into what a Social Media Audit&nbsp;is.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>A Social Media Audit is the process of reviewing all&nbsp;Social&nbsp;Media entities pertaining to a brand&nbsp;(or brands)&nbsp;to&nbsp;improve digital hygiene.</strong></p>



<p>When we talk about a Social Media audit, we are referring to:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Leveraging technology and subject matter expertise to identify, collect and categorize all&nbsp;Social Media channels associated with a given brand or brands into one inventory. </strong>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>The categories of the inventory that are relevant for you may differ brand by brand depending on how your global Social Media channels are managed but typically we are looking at three areas: </p>



<p>1. Authorized&nbsp;active pages&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Authorized&nbsp;dormant pages&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. Rogue pages</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>2) By having an inventory broken down into these categories, it will&nbsp;give you &nbsp;visibility of what your&nbsp;consumers are exposed to on&nbsp;Social Media. </strong></p>



<p>If you put the consumer at the heart of your business then this can be a very valuable way of seeing what risks they are exposed to, and the content they are exposed to that doesn’t align with your core objectives and values. It can also be the first step in regaining control over your Social Media presence through identifying those channels with lost access and rogue sites impersonating your brands. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you know where your risks are and the nature of them, you can tailor a Brand Protection solution that works for you to tackle these risks.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-why-does-this-matter-and-what-are-the-issues"><strong>Why does this matter&nbsp;and what are the issues?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>As the world becomes increasingly digitized, consumers are spending more time on social&nbsp;media interacting with the brands they love. This increases their exposure to illegitimate or dormant entities, ultimately resulting in erosion of brand equity if not acted on.</strong></p>



<p>The core reasons why a Social Media audit matters and the issues that need to be tackled: </p>



<ul><li>Social Media is the route to market for many brands and where consumers go to engage with those brands. &nbsp;</li><li>The global COVID-19 pandemic has pushed more consumers online and with that a new demographic of users that may be more susceptible to fake competitions, scams, and rogue pages. </li><li>Dormant pages often share outdated/inconsistent messaging which can cause consumer confusion e.g. wrong logos, links to broken websites etc. and run the risk of being hacked. </li><li>Bad actors are&nbsp;capitalizing&nbsp;on this, setting up impersonation pages which divert consumers towards their pages for several reasons. </li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-why-do-people-set-up-impersonation-rogue-pages-and-why-this-matters"><strong>Why&nbsp;do&nbsp;people set up Impersonation/rogue pages and why&nbsp;this matters?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>Bad actors are always on the&nbsp;lookout&nbsp;to increase traffic to their websites and trick consumers into&nbsp;purchasing illegitimate products or&nbsp;handing&nbsp;over&nbsp;their personal details.&nbsp;Impersonation&nbsp;and hijacking brand keywords&nbsp;/&nbsp;trademarks&nbsp;are&nbsp;seen by bad actors&nbsp;as&nbsp;easy, cost-effective&nbsp;methods&nbsp;for profiting off vulnerable consumers.</strong></p>



<p>There are several key&nbsp;reasons why impersonation/rogue pages are set up: </p>



<ul><li>To funnel well intentioned consumers towards fake competitions they are running which often lead to phishing scams that aim to defraud you. Many ask for bank details or expose you to malware and adware. &nbsp;</li><li>To trade in counterfeits or other IP infringing products &nbsp;</li><li>To trade in non-IP&nbsp;infringing products that are unrelated to your goods; nevertheless, they are using your brands to channel consumers to their pages. &nbsp;</li><li>As rogue fan accounts,&nbsp;set up to share inappropriate content or use offensive language which if your target audience are families or young children can be very damaging. &nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Ultimately all of this can mislead or confuse consumers which leads to a negative digital experience associated with your brand. It is damaging to your brand reputation and trust and confidence in your brands and will result in an increase in consumer complaints. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-benefits-of-identifying-and-resolving-these-risks"><strong>Benefits of identifying&nbsp;and resolving&nbsp;these risks</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>By undertaking a&nbsp;Social Media Audit, your business can build a full picture of the&nbsp;Social Media landscape&nbsp;and view what your consumer sees.&nbsp;From protecting consumers to refocusing your marketing campaigns, the benefits are felt across the business.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ensure effective marketing campaigns </strong>&#8211; Use a Social Media Audit to find out where you need to reclaim control of your Social Media presence to streamline the release of new marketing campaigns. </p>



<p><strong>Increase the visibility of authorized channels </strong>&#8211; By  removing unauthorized channels, you will increase the visibility of authorized channels thereby&nbsp;channeling&nbsp;more consumers to those pages which may lead to an increase in revenue generation from Social Media commerce.</p>



<p><strong>Protect consumer trust </strong>&#8211; Tackle issues that harm consumer trust by removing impersonation pages that engage with consumers on behalf of your brand or offer infringing and sometimes unsafe products for sale. This will also lead to a reduction in the number of complaints you receive from consumers online.</p>



<p><strong>Protect consumers from real harms</strong> &#8211; Stop cyber threats in the form of fake competitions/scams which aim to defraud your consumers, and prevent exposure to inappropriate/explicit content which you would not wish to be associated with your brand.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-do-you-need-to-overcome-these-issues"><strong>What do you need to overcome these issues?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>A combination of a Brand Protection technology solution and subject matter&nbsp;</strong><strong>expertise</strong><strong>&nbsp;is needed to overcome issues&nbsp;</strong><strong>flagged in your&nbsp;</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>ocial&nbsp;</strong><strong>M</strong><strong>edia&nbsp;</strong><strong>Audit</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Identify</strong>&nbsp;– Technology solution to go out and scour all Social Media platforms for channels utilizing your branding . This can be a useful exercise to understand the nature of those risk faced on Social Media which can feed into your wider Brand Protection strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Remove</strong>&nbsp;– Combination of both&nbsp;Brand Protection&nbsp;technology and expertise. This is where you need a tech solution combined with&nbsp;Brand Protection Analyst team to remove these risks using your IP assets and industry knowledge as the tools.  &nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>If you have a global brand presence then it is likely that you will be exposed to some of the risks mentioned with many brands running over many Social Media platforms across many geographies. </li><li>This is exacerbated if you have a large decentralized management of your Social Media presence or outsource your Social Media management to external agents. &nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>In this Whiteboard Tutorial, we’ve outlined what a Social Media Audit is, discussed why it is important, and listed the key&nbsp;</strong><strong>benefits to your business.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Bad actors are adept at avoiding traditional detection techniques used by Brand Protection teams. You need to deploy image capabilities to discover the hidden listings and posts that are undermining your brand and putting consumers at risk.<br />
<br />
In this Whiteboard Tutorial, we detail why image capabilities are critical for discovering high-risk infringements; explore the ‘Power of Three’ – Logo Detection, Similarity Matching, &amp; OCR; and set out real-world examples of image capabilities being used to discover hidden bad actors.</p>
