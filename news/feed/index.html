<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Corsearch and Incopro Join Forces to Support a Cleaner Internet and a Better Society</strong></p>



<p><em>As eCommerce and digital content boom, Corsearch and Incopro will create a global team capable of restoring trust against counterfeiting, brand abuse, and piracy</em></p>



<p><strong>LONDON, (June 10 2021) </strong>&#8212;&nbsp;Corsearch&nbsp;is pleased to announce the acquisition of the online brand protection provider,&nbsp;Incopro, in a deal which&nbsp;further enhances&nbsp;Corsearch&#8217;s&nbsp;brand and content protection capabilities.&nbsp;Like&nbsp;Corsearch,&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;is an agile and innovative company that has pioneered new technologies to meet the increasing challenges of a complex online environment.&nbsp;Incopro’s&nbsp;technology-enabled team protects more than 750 brands from counterfeiting and IP abuse&nbsp;and&nbsp;the combination&nbsp;of the two companies&nbsp;reflects a commitment to further developing and delivering the solutions that brands and IP businesses need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dramatic growth of eCommerce and digital media consumption mean that companies and consumers now rely on the Internet more than ever. Alongside the opportunities presented by global markets, however, come the increasingly common threats of counterfeiting,&nbsp;gray&nbsp;trade,&nbsp;brand&nbsp;abuse, and online piracy. More than ever before, brand protection solutions that use advanced technologies to reduce brand risks and protect consumer welfare are critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>From enterprise-level corporations to SMBs, IP owners need a comprehensive brand protection solution built on a global network of technology, data, and expertise.&nbsp;Corsearch&nbsp;is a trusted name for brands in need of innovative, expert support against the loss of revenue and reputational damage caused by IP abuse.

<p>Corsearch&nbsp;CEO, Tobi Hartmann, said: </p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#009ca6" class="has-inline-color"><strong>“For years now, we have been impressed not just with&nbsp;Incopro’s&nbsp;future-facing technologies and global outlook, but with its commitment to the principle of restoring trust in digital commerce. In the past,&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;has invited its brand customers to join ‘a bigger gang’ against counterfeiting and IP abuse — well, we are delighted that they have agreed to join the global team at&nbsp;Corsearch&nbsp;as we come together&nbsp;to support&nbsp;a cleaner Internet and a better society.”&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>Simon&nbsp;Baggs, CEO of&nbsp;Incopro,&nbsp;said: </p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong><span style="color:#009ca6" class="has-inline-color">“This&nbsp;is a really exciting opportunity for my management&nbsp;team&nbsp;and staff to&nbsp;join together&nbsp;with the talented team at&nbsp;Corsearch&nbsp;– to work together to deliver the technology and solutions that&nbsp;brand&nbsp;and IP owners need. We are thrilled that we will&nbsp;have&nbsp;an even stronger&nbsp;combined&nbsp;voice. We look forward to working even more&nbsp;closely with Internet platforms and&nbsp;to&nbsp;shouting loudly&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;protections&nbsp;that&nbsp;rights owners&nbsp;deserve.&nbsp;I want to thank our customers,&nbsp;staff,&nbsp;and shareholders&nbsp;for their&nbsp;huge support. There is so much more we can do together!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>Though online marketplaces like Amazon may have helped make shopping easier, it can often be difficult to tell if what you are getting is the real thing or not.</p>



<p>People spent $861.1 billion shopping online with U.S. retailers last year, up 44 percent from the year before thanks to the pandemic per&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2021/02/15/ecommerce-during-coronavirus-pandemic-in-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Commerce 360</a>. With the online shopping boom comes more opportunities to make money off fake items. While high price point items like fake watches and handbags have always been popular, cheaper things like hand sanitizer and masks have also increased in prevalence. &#8220;Counterfeit items respond to changes in consumer behavior,&#8221; said brand protection company Incopro CEO Simon Baggs. &#8220;What&#8217;s selling is what people are searching for.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, it seems that the majority of fake items may be coming from the same sellers without anything to stop them. Incopro looked at more than 1.5 million IP infringement notices automatically filed on behalf of over 750 brands on 34 different online marketplaces including Alibaba, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter from November 2019 to November 2020. Overall, it estimates companies lose about $320 billion annually on consumers purchasing illicit goods, whether they know it or not.</p>

<p>If a rising tide lifts all boats, that must also apply to counterfeit products on ecommerce and social sites. What happens when digital advertising gets thrown into the mix to sell the counterfeit products?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecommerce became one of the fastest-growing segments for retail in North America and Europe in 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for goods and services, many unattainable in brick-and-mortar stores.</p>



<p>U.S. sales from ecommerce in 2020 were estimated to reach $794.5 billion &#8212; up 32% year-on-year, according to eMarketer.</p>



<p>As ecommerce continues to grow, it is estimated that the global, economic value of counterfeiting and piracy could reach $4.2 trillion by 2022, placing 5.4 million legitimate jobs at risk during the same period, according to a study released by Incopro.</p>



<p>&#8220;While we regularly hear from brands that repeat offenders are a challenge, we were surprised by the scale of issues that are driven by a small proportion of offenders, with only 3% of the most egregious offenders responsible for over 20% of issues,&#8221; said Piers Barclay, chief strategy&nbsp;officer at Incopro.</p>

<p><em>Study finds that infringements could be reduced by up to 24% with a &#8216;three strikes&#8217; ban that stops aggressive repeat offenders across major online marketplaces and social sites</em> </p>



<p><strong>April&nbsp;</strong><strong>22</strong><strong>, 2021, LO</strong><strong>NDON and LO</strong><strong>S ANGELES &#8212;&nbsp;</strong>A new study released today by online brand&nbsp;protection software provider, <a href="http://www.incoproip.com/%22%20/o%20%22http://www.incoproip.com%22%20/t%20%22_blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incopro,</a> has found that a core group of repeat sellers are responsible for a disproportionate share of illicit activity on online marketplaces and social sites. In the study,&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;analyzed more than 1.5 million automated requests, sent on behalf of 750+ brands between November 2019 and November 2020, asking for illicit offers for sale to be removed across 34 global marketplaces and social sites.&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;found that one in five of its automated requests to remove fake listings related to 3% of illicit sellers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the report, titled: <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/three-strikes-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Three Strikes and Out: How Ecommerce Platforms Can Protect Consumers from Repeat Offenders,“</a> Incopro&nbsp;also explores the connection between repeat sellers of illicit goods and services and the monetary gain that could be secured if online marketplaces and social sites were to implement two baseline requirements: (1) all seller identities should be verified; and (2) all sellers should be removed from the marketplace or social site if identified as selling illicit goods and services on more than three occasions (&#8220;three strikes&#8221;). Implementing a uniform approach could significantly reduce illicit sales and save up to $78B of losses annually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;With the pandemic driving an accelerated shift to online retail, it is critical that more is done to protect brands and consumers,&#8221; said Simon&nbsp;Baggs, CEO and co-founder of&nbsp;Incopro. &#8220;We are seeing huge increases in brand misuse, a trend which has already caught the eye of legislators in the United States and Europe. I hope this study will inform and accelerate legislative change, driving a consistent approach to seller verification and sanctions for repeat illicit activity.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to&nbsp;Incopro&#8217;s&nbsp;study:&nbsp;</p>



<p>·     The most aggressive, repeated use of ecommerce operations to infringe rights and harm consumers comes from only 3% of illicit sellers.&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;defined this group as sellers whose listings have been flagged to online platforms on more than three separate days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>·     21% of all the removal requests sent to online platforms by&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;concerned the most aggressive group of repeat illicit sellers; hence, one out of five illicit offers for sale are generated by a core of 3% of wrongdoers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>·     Currently, 68% of the online marketplaces and social sites analyzed (23 of 34) have some policy in place to tackle repeat sellers of illegitimate goods; however, only three of these platforms have publicly announced, strict &#8220;three strikes&#8221; policies that consistently result in banning repeat illicit sellers:&nbsp;Alibaba,&nbsp;Aliexpress, and&nbsp;Taobao.&nbsp;</p>



<p>·     A minimum of 11% of all harmful online offers could be stopped immediately if robust seller verification was combined with a consistently implemented &#8220;three strikes&#8221; model (i.e., banning flagged sellers after three separate days of enforcement). This figure rises to 24% if the removal policy were applied more strictly (i.e., banning sellers after three non-genuine listings).&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hzjb9c/global_brand?w=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Global Brand Counterfeiting Report,</a> monetary losses suffered by the public due to online counterfeiting are estimated at $323B annually. If consumers are exposed to 11% fewer non-genuine offers on ecommerce platforms worldwide (per&nbsp;Incopro&#8217;s&nbsp;findings above), this would amount to $35B saved &#8212; and $78B saved with stricter policies. The equivalent revenue would also be captured by the true rights holders selling legitimate products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Added&nbsp;Baggs: &#8220;Nearly two thirds of consumers lose trust in a marketplace after being deceived by a counterfeit seller, according to a recent&nbsp;Incopro <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/news/2-out-of-3-consumers-believe-that-brands-are-responsible-for-protecting-them-from-fake-products-and-misleading-marketing-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumer survey.</a> Platforms have much to gain from instituting stricter measures that lead to the removal of repeat sellers of illicit goods and services, including a reduced admin workload and increased trust in their own brands.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/three-strikes-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> full report</a> is now available for download at <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.incoproip.com/reports/</a>. Incopro will also host a <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/events-and-webinars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">webinar</a> to address the research findings in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>The footwear and clothing industries remain the most impacted by counterfeiting across the globe, making up <strong>22% </strong>and <strong>16% </strong>of total value of seizures respectively (Source: OECD). And fashion&nbsp;and&nbsp;beauty counterfeits&nbsp;have surged during COVID-19, as brand exploiters have taken advantage of new, less savvy online consumers.</p>



<p>This issue is only compounded during e-commerce events such as Black Friday. In the week of Thanksgiving / run up to Black Friday / Cyber Monday 2020, compared to a week 3 months back, Incopro’s technology detected:</p>



<ul><li><strong>155%</strong>&nbsp;growth of high-risk listings on eBay for a watch/jewelry retailer</li><li><strong>121%</strong>&nbsp;increase in high-risk listings on Amazon for a luxury brand</li><li><strong>51%</strong>&nbsp;increase in high-risk listings on Amazon for a streetwear brand</li></ul>



<p>But what can brands do to stop this?</p>



<p>Incopro Senior Legal Counsel <strong>Mike Sweeney</strong> joined Vogue Business&#8217; webinar: “The Counterfeiter Surge and How to Avoid It&#8221; on 4 December, sharing his insights on how fashion and clothing brands can better protect consumers and brand value online.</p>

<p><em>Research findings support that protecting brand authenticity is becoming a critical element of consumer engagement</em></p>



<p><strong>December 16, 2020, LOS ANGELES and LONDON &#8212;&nbsp;</strong>A new consumer survey released today by online brand protection software provider,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.incoproip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incopro</a>, delves into shopper perspectives on the role that brand authenticity plays in their decision-making process in time for the holiday season and looking ahead to 2021. The findings also have implications for brands in terms of how to market their products in a way that nurtures a sense of the original, builds trust, and retains customers while growing market share. The survey was conducted with 2,000 U.S. respondents in November 2020, in partnership with marketing research firm, Savanta.</p>



<p>&#8220;With online shopping at an all-time high, and consumers on the lookout for holiday deals, we wanted to run this survey to take the pulse of where brand authenticity stands with consumers today,&#8221; said Piers Barclay, chief strategy officer at Incopro. &#8220;Having worked with hundreds of leading consumer brands, we have seen the damage counterfeit goods and other scams can cause. We have also seen the speed at which bad actors, such as counterfeiters, impersonators, and copycats, react to new opportunities that arise as consumers move online. Our research has demonstrated, not only that brand authenticity is vital to consumers, but also that many consumers view this area as the brand&#8217;s responsibility.&#8221;</p>



<p>The shift online, coupled with minimal or non-existent regulation for e-commerce, search and social platforms, has led to an explosion in fake goods and inauthentic brand experiences. The rise of ‘insta-shopping’ and the ability of malicious actors to replicate complete brand experiences means that trust in brands is more at risk than ever before. While no brand can control all of the content that consumers are exposed to in their name, establishing where to act and how stresses the importance of gaining a comprehensive view of “what’s out there” – from the customers’ vantage point. Incopro&#8217;s new consumer survey found that:</p>



<ul><li><strong>U.S. shoppers continue to run into fakes on the Internet&nbsp;</strong>– Approximately a quarter (24%) of U.S. consumers reported that they have been sold counterfeit products. More than a third (36%) have experienced fake ads or social posts, while 41% have come across fake websites and 35% noted fake social media accounts.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Brand reputations can be significantly impacted when they are targeted by counterfeiters</strong>&nbsp;– Three out of four U.S. consumers, (73%) said they would be put off by a brand after unwittingly buying fake products. And 63% said that simply Googling and landing on a fake web page would taint the brand in their eyes. The vast majority (79%) of respondents said it was either very or extremely important for brands to feel real and authentic.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Consumers believe that fakes are a problem</strong>&nbsp;–60% of respondents said that they agree with this statement. 71% are concerned about counterfeit goods feeding into criminal activity.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Brands are responsible for the public’s protection from counterfeit goods</strong>&nbsp;– 69% of consumers surveyed believe that brands are responsible for protecting shoppers from fake versions of their products sold online, and 65% of respondents feel that brands are responsible for protecting them from fake marketing content (e.g., communications, websites, etc.). Additionally, 77% of consumers believe that brands are responsible for reporting fake social media accounts that impersonate them.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Consumers think that brands can do more about fakes&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; 71% of consumers believe that brands should be doing more to protect them from impersonating brands and phishing attacks. Only 33% of consumers see fraudulent products and content as an unavoidable part of today’s world.</li></ul>



<p>The survey findings reveal that brands are falling below consumer expectations in dealing with the counterfeit goods problem. They are looking to brands to do more and that may mean extending responsibility beyond legal and deeper into marketing departments.</p>



<p>“Marketers are responsible for consumer engagement and how consumers perceive their brands across every conceivable touchpoint,” added Barclay. “If more marketers become accountable for monitoring and stopping the threats to their brands&#8217; authenticity, we will see them deliver a truly outstanding experience. That’s why we are seeing growth in the number of marketers embracing protection as a new 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;“P” of marketing, alongside product, place, price and promotion.”</p>

<p>The explosion of e-commerce over the last year has been a godsend for brands and retailers that are struggling with store closures, but it comes with its own set of risks. For one, the combination of e-commerce growth and the holiday shopping rush has led to a significant increase in the amount of counterfeit goods being sold in the U.S.</p>



<p>According to data from brand protection agency Incopro, Black Friday saw a rise in the amount of counterfeits across sectors and platforms. EBay’s watch and jewelry category saw a 155% increase in high-risk listings (identified by Incopro’s fake-spotting algorithm) at select brands. On Amazon, some luxury goods saw a 121% increase in high risk listings and a 51% increase was flagged for some streetwear brands sold on the platform. Black Friday typically sees a growth in counterfeits being sold every year. Last year, there was a 156% increase in cosmetics counterfeits on Amazon from October to November, driven primarily by sellers in the space looking to bank off Black Friday sales.</p>



<p>“E-commerce has exploded this year, particularly around the holidays, and counterfeiters know this,” said Piers Barclay, chief strategy officer at Incopro. “In many ways, the counterfeiters are businesspeople, just like anyone else. So where there’s a lot of growth, that’s where they’ll be. Twenty years ago, counterfeiting was about selling something on the street corner. But the explosion of e-commerce and platforms like eBay has made it a lot easier.”</p>
