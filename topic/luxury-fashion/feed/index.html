<h3>About Ted Baker</h3>



<p id="h-ted-baker-is-no-ordinary-designer-label-having-launched-as-a-shirt-specialist-in-1987-they-ve-always-sought-to-do-things-their-way-as-they-ve-grown-from-one-store-in-glasgow-into-a-global-brand">Ted Baker is ‘No Ordinary Designer Label’. Having launched as a shirt specialist in 1987 they’ve always sought to do things their way as they’ve grown from one store in Glasgow into a global brand.</p>



<p>Ted Baker now has a portfolio of stores in the UK and US, along with Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Taiwan, and achieved this whilst retaining their identity as a quintessentially English brand with a quirky sense of humour.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left heading-branded" id="h-the-rising-counterfeit-challenge">The rising counterfeit challenge </h2>



<p>This focus of innovation and approaching things in a different way was a key driver behind their early embrace of ecommerce. As such, the Ted Baker website is now an essential part of their brand and shoppers from around the world can purchase the latest Ted clothes from the comfort of their homes.</p>



<p>Originally, counterfeits were sold in markets and physical stores rather than through online sales and auction sites. The challenge online came to the fore around 2014 not just for Ted Baker, but the whole industry.</p>



<p>As any large brand can vouch for, having a significant online presence brings both opportunity and risk. With a brand as popular as Ted Baker, they have to remain diligent and proactive to ensure that they protect both their business and their customers.</p>

<h3 id="h-collaboration">Collaboration</h3>



<p>Ted Baker believes a collaborative approach is the best way to help shape key issues and influence public policy. As such, they are a member of several groups, including: The Anti-Counterfeiting Group (ACG), Asian Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy (ACACAP), React and the Real-Deal initiative. Through these groups, Ted Baker collaborate with other brands, share information and work towards intelligence-led enforcement.</p>

<h3 id="h-intelligence-led-enforcement">Intelligence-led enforcement</h3>



<p>The sheer size of the internet makes it impossible for one person, or a team, to be able to look at everything online manually. Ted Baker realized that the only way to tackle the issue was to pull all infringements into one system and to correlate all that information so that they are able to prioritize the workload and focus their resources.</p>
