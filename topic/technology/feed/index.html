<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Counterfeit goods have been around for a long time, but with the boom of the internet and e-commerce, their availability has skyrocketed. Counterfeiters continue to become more organized and more sophisticated in the way they con innocent consumers using websites, online marketplaces, and social media.</p>



<p>Counterfeits damage company revenues, put consumers’ safety at risk and there is evidence to show that counterfeit products are linked to criminal networks or organized crime; involving tax evasion, money laundering, illegal drugs, slave labor, and human trafficking.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>“Partnering with Incopro has been a great achievement in our online fight against counterfeits. We have been working together since August 2018 and the results have been very gratifying. Brother needed a specialized and dedicated team to fight online counterfeits in Europe and partnering with Incopro gave us that capability.”</strong></p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left heading-branded" id="h-fighting-the-counterfeit-issue">Fighting the counterfeit issue</h2>



<p>Brother’s main concern with counterfeiting is the damage that it can cause their partners and end consumers. If they are not proactive in fighting the issue and a consumer unintentionally purchases a counterfeit it can have damaging consequences on brand trust and reputation.</p>



<p>For example, counterfeit toners and inks have been independently tested and results show the significant damage they can cause to printers. They are poorly constructed and when used with a legitimate printer will often cause downtime and damage which will result in further maintenance costs.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left heading-branded" id="h-how-has-incopro-helped">How has Incopro helped?</h2>



<p>Since Brother first partnered with Incopro, Incopro analysts have enforced on over 130,000 listings across Europe that infringed their copyrights and trademarks. This equates to over 1,600 sellers across 20 online marketplaces in 18 countries. In addition to this, Incopro has actioned across 100 websites/domains and continues to enforce on social media platforms. This work has reduced third party listing infringements in search results from&nbsp;<strong>85%</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>20%.</strong></p>



<p>Another critical part of the service offered is through the strong relationships Incopro has with online marketplaces. Through this Incopro has been able to lobby for platform restructure to stop infringing listings from creating brand confusion.<br></p>

<h2 id="h-a-complete-brand-protection-strategy">A complete Brand Protection strategy</h2>



<p>Identifying and enforcing infringement online is a vital part of any Brand Protection strategy. However, many companies will also require an offline component.&nbsp;Incopro partners with offline investigators in key regions around the world to ensure that we can assist your entire strategy from end-to-end.</p>



<h3 id="h-who-is-wri">Who is WRi?</h3>



<p>One of our offline investigators is the UK based company <strong><a href="https://wri-group.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WRi</a></strong>. They specialise in anti-counterfeiting &amp; anti-piracy investigations and assist their clients by reducing the threat of Intellectual Property (IP) crime, fraud, money laundering and other shadow economy activities.</p>



<p>They have a reputation for delivering results and have partnered with some of the world’s largest brands, providing them with reactive and proactive on-the-ground defence, from the end customer up through the supply chain. Incopro will provide WRi with details about infringers, and they will then run test purchases and conduct further investigation before potentially raiding and closing down criminal operations.</p>



<h3 id="h-closing-down-a-large-scale-operation">Closing down a large-scale operation</h3>



<p>WRi worked with a market-leading, global electronics company who were suffering from a large-scale counterfeiting issue. This issue went beyond lost revenue as there was a health and safety risk around counterfeited electronic goods which could cause major reputational damage.</p>



<p>WRi utilized Incopro’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/product/talisman-online-brand-protection">Talisman&nbsp;</a>system to identify the infringer through image and web searching. They were prioritised as a target based on their low-priced repair services in which they used suspected counterfeit parts and the promotion of wholesale parts. Incopro was also able to identify multiple infringing eBay listings connected to them and this lead to the infringer’s eBay store where their contact details were identified, including physical location.</p>



<h3 id="h-raiding-the-premises">Raiding the premises</h3>



<p>WRi took this information and liaised with external public-sector partners (Police, Trading Standards and Border Force), from whom they received notice of a shipment of counterfeit goods heading to the trader. After further investigation that the company was a large-scale importer and seller of counterfeit goods, WRi raided the premises with the authorities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The raid was successful and led to the confiscation of over 9,000 counterfeit and potentially unsafe items.</p></blockquote>



<p>An examination of the premises also revealed links to a supplier based in Hong Kong which has led to a further investigation. Additional contact details have since been identified, along with location of the Hong Kong premises and the confirmed association between the two entities, as well as their director’s UK residential address. &nbsp;The trader is currently being prosecuted and to our knowledge no longer trading in counterfeit stock.</p>



<h3 id="h-talisman">Talisman</h3>



<p>Talisman is the market leader at identifying targets and cleaning up online spaces, and this technology is also instrumental in supporting offline work.
