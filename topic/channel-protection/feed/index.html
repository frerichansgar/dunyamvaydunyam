<h3>About Ted Baker</h3>



<p id="h-ted-baker-is-no-ordinary-designer-label-having-launched-as-a-shirt-specialist-in-1987-they-ve-always-sought-to-do-things-their-way-as-they-ve-grown-from-one-store-in-glasgow-into-a-global-brand">Ted Baker is ‘No Ordinary Designer Label’. Having launched as a shirt specialist in 1987 they’ve always sought to do things their way as they’ve grown from one store in Glasgow into a global brand.</p>



<p>Ted Baker now has a portfolio of stores in the UK and US, along with Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Taiwan, and achieved this whilst retaining their identity as a quintessentially English brand with a quirky sense of humour.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left heading-branded" id="h-the-rising-counterfeit-challenge">The rising counterfeit challenge </h2>



<p>This focus of innovation and approaching things in a different way was a key driver behind their early embrace of ecommerce. As such, the Ted Baker website is now an essential part of their brand and shoppers from around the world can purchase the latest Ted clothes from the comfort of their homes.</p>



<p>Originally, counterfeits were sold in markets and physical stores rather than through online sales and auction sites. The challenge online came to the fore around 2014 not just for Ted Baker, but the whole industry.</p>



<p>As any large brand can vouch for, having a significant online presence brings both opportunity and risk. With a brand as popular as Ted Baker, they have to remain diligent and proactive to ensure that they protect both their business and their customers.</p>

<h3 id="h-collaboration">Collaboration</h3>



<p>Ted Baker believes a collaborative approach is the best way to help shape key issues and influence public policy. As such, they are a member of several groups, including: The Anti-Counterfeiting Group (ACG), Asian Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy (ACACAP), React and the Real-Deal initiative. Through these groups, Ted Baker collaborate with other brands, share information and work towards intelligence-led enforcement.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3 id="h-intelligence-led-enforcement">Intelligence-led enforcement</h3>



<p>The sheer size of the internet makes it impossible for one person, or a team, to be able to look at everything online manually. Ted Baker realized that the only way to tackle the issue was to pull all infringements into one system and to correlate all that information so that they are able to prioritize the workload and focus their resources.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Counterfeit goods have been around for a long time, but with the boom of the internet and e-commerce, their availability has skyrocketed. Counterfeiters continue to become more organized and more sophisticated in the way they con innocent consumers using websites, online marketplaces, and social media.</p>



<p>Counterfeits damage company revenues, put consumers’ safety at risk and there is evidence to show that counterfeit products are linked to criminal networks or organized crime; involving tax evasion, money laundering, illegal drugs, slave labor, and human trafficking.</p>

<p>Brother’s main concern with counterfeiting is the damage that it can cause their partners and end consumers. If they are not proactive in fighting the issue and a consumer unintentionally purchases a counterfeit it can have damaging consequences on brand trust and reputation.</p>



<p>For example, counterfeit toners and inks have been independently tested and results show the significant damage they can cause to printers. They are poorly constructed and when used with a legitimate printer will often cause downtime and damage which will result in further maintenance costs.</p>

<p>Since Brother first partnered with Incopro, Incopro analysts have enforced on over 130,000 listings across Europe that infringed their copyrights and trademarks. This equates to over 1,600 sellers across 20 online marketplaces in 18 countries. In addition to this, Incopro has actioned across 100 websites/domains and continues to enforce on social media platforms. This work has reduced third party listing infringements in search results from&nbsp;<strong>85%</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>20%.</strong></p>



<p>Another critical part of the service offered is through the strong relationships Incopro has with online marketplaces. Through this Incopro has been able to lobby for platform restructure to stop infringing listings from creating brand confusion.<br></p>

<p>The Air-Pot is a revolutionary horticulture container that has been developed, patented and trademarked by the Caledonian Tree Company. Now into its sixth generation, the container has been designed to guarantee healthy root development and maximize aeration. The Air-Pots last up to ten years, and the company ensures that they have the strongest sustainability credentials by making them from recycled plastic.</p>

<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>In the early 2000s, Caledonian Tree Company first noticed that they had a counterfeit issue coming out of China and as the popularity of their product grew, so did their infringement problem. The counterfeits they found were all about creating cheaply produced imitations of the Air-Pot that undercut the cost of the legitimate product.</p>



<p>These illegitimate listings are easily confused by consumers with genuine Air-Pots when making purchases online. Counterfeits that do make their way into the hands of unsuspecting, would-be consumers, can damage the goodwill and trust carefully built by the company over the last two decades.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>The imitations are not created with the recycled plastic that is so core to the appeal of Air-Pots, and they often get the important details of the pot wrong that make such a difference in the success of the product. Counterfeiters are unable to provide the expert advice that is supplied by either Caledonian Tree Company or one of their distributors which can play a critical role in the successful use of the product for first-time buyers.</p>

<p>Caledonian Tree Company attempted to stop the counterfeits internally. This meant staff members were having to spend time away from their regular roles to clear up online channels manually. However, with the scale of the internet and the volume of online marketplaces and websites, the problem was too large to fix without technology.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><img width="159" height="147" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/legal-action.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-663"/></figure></div>

<h3 id="h-by-partnering-with-incopro">By partnering with Incopro</h3>



<p>Caledonian Tree Company gained a holistic view of their problem and online channels. The results so far have shown a lasting significant impact on the problem with:</p>



<ul><li>over 1,400 marketplace listings taken down</li><li>content removed on over 60 websites</li><li>numerous social media posts removed</li></ul>



<p>This demonstrates how Incopro’s analysts have been able to disrupt the counterfeit behavior, most notably in China, and how their work has led to a drastic reduction in infringement on Caledonian Tree Company’s brand in the region and around the world.</p>
