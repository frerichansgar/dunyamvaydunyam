<p>Unilever operates over 400 brand names and employs over 149,000 people across 190 countries. It is a global company with a global purpose.</p>

<h3 id="h-1-threat-of-online-counterfeiting">1. Threat of online counterfeiting&nbsp;</h3>



<p>As with every multinational FMCG company, Unilever grapples with counterfeiters exploiting&nbsp;its brands.&nbsp;Following the rapid growth in e-commerce, counterfeiters have shifted their criminal operations online. Unilever&#8217;s team recognized this and set out to develop a strong program to support and protect its brands in the digital ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-2-siloed-working-across-the-brand-protection-function">2. Siloed working&nbsp;across the Brand Protection&nbsp;function&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Unilever’s large global team and regional coverage led to siloed working. Prior to working with Incopro, it was very difficult for the team to make large, connected takedowns. It was impossible for the team to connect its online and offline activities, so it were unable to see a holistic picture of the illicit activities impacting Unilever brands. Unilever stressed the need for a solution that would facilitate collaboration and data sharing.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3 id="h-3-no-visibility-of-digital-footprint">3. No visibility of&nbsp;digital footprint&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Legitimate assets, imagery, and messaging found online comprise a brand’s&nbsp;“digital&nbsp;footprint”.&nbsp;Unilever’s team&nbsp;identified&nbsp;that&nbsp;it did not have a technology solution in-house that enabled&nbsp;them&nbsp;to monitor and analyze&nbsp;the sprawling digital footprints of its brands.&nbsp;It was essential that a solution&nbsp;was&nbsp;brought in&nbsp;to&nbsp;help Unilever gain visibility of its legitimate online presence and control it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">To&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to find&nbsp;a&nbsp;best-in-class Brand Protection vendor,&nbsp;Unilever&nbsp;engaged in a global benchmarking exercise.&nbsp;The team took a step back&nbsp;to evaluate&nbsp;its&nbsp;requirements across the different&nbsp;digital channels accessed by&nbsp;its&nbsp;consumers, such as marketplaces, e-commerce websites, and social media.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-focusing-on-impact-not-number-of-takedowns">Focusing on impact,&nbsp;not number of&nbsp;takedowns&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A key requirement was&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;commercial impact for the business.&nbsp;Unilever previously worked with&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;vendors in the Brand&nbsp;Protection&nbsp;space, but they&nbsp;would&nbsp;focus&nbsp;on the number of&nbsp;takedowns&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;securing a lasting&nbsp;reduction in&nbsp;brand misuse.&nbsp;Now, Unilever&nbsp;applies advanced&nbsp;network&nbsp;analysis&nbsp;to&nbsp;connect&nbsp;the dots to understand the players behind&nbsp;the illicit&nbsp;listings and take down&nbsp;entire&nbsp;companies&nbsp;and&nbsp;their&nbsp;online operations, not just&nbsp;individual&nbsp;accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Incopro&nbsp;was selected as&nbsp;Unilever’s&nbsp;best-in-class&nbsp;supplier upon review of&nbsp;all other vendors&nbsp;within the market.&nbsp;The partnership focuses on&nbsp;cross-functional&nbsp;collaboration and&nbsp;a shared&nbsp;understanding&nbsp;of Unilever’s overall&nbsp;strategy – rather than just providing data dumps of listings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Incopro’s&nbsp;market-leading&nbsp;<a href="/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Brand&nbsp;Protection&nbsp;technology, Talisman,</a>&nbsp;was a core driver behind Unilever’s decision.&nbsp;With&nbsp;sophisticated&nbsp;detection capabilities and a robust threat-prioritization system,&nbsp;Unilever is&nbsp;now&nbsp;able to swiftly identify and remove the key threats facing its consumers,&nbsp;cleaning&nbsp;up critical e-commerce channels.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>“One of the reasons that we selected Incopro was due to Talisman’s advanced Network Analysis tool and the capabilities this provides.”</strong></p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center heading-branded" id="h-managing-unilever-s-digital-footprint">Managing&nbsp;Unilever’s&nbsp;digital footprint&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A core focus area of Incopro and Unilever’s partnership is monitoring and analyzing the legitimate digital presence for Unilever’s brand portfolio, with the goal of improving the “footprint” left behind. This is an essential activity for when the messaging, imagery, or overall strategy of a Unilever brand is pivoted.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns mb-0">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3 id="h-example-beauty-product-rebrand">Example:&nbsp;Beauty product rebrand&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Two years ago the strategy for a beauty brand within Unilever&#8217;s portfolio shifted, refreshing the brand name and associated messaging. With Incopro’s technology, the brand&#8217;s team was able to identify that nearly <strong>80% </strong>of the images that were still being broadcast online were from old marketing packs and no longer relevant to the brand.</p>



<p>This enabled&nbsp;the team to isolate&nbsp;past digital&nbsp;content and remove it from websites, marketplaces,&nbsp;and social media platforms&nbsp;to prevent consumer confusion.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center heading-branded" id="h-flagging-high-risk-parallel-imports">Flagging high-risk parallel imports</h2>



<p>Unilever has a large portfolio of brands available across countless territories and regions. Each territory will have its own regulatory regime, and products will need approval before being distributed. Additional to discovering counterfeits and brand misuse, Talisman flags parallel import goods that are being sold in territories without regulatory approval, preventing reputational damage and potential penalties. </p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3 id="h-example-products-being-imported-into-us-without-approval">Example:&nbsp;Products being imported into US without approval</h3>



<p>Talisman revealed that <strong>70%</strong> of US listings for one of Unilever&#8217;s global beauty brands were being shipped from India, and the products likely did not have FDA approval. Prior to partnering with Incopro, Unilever&#8217;s brand teams had little visibility of parallel imports and could not proactively enforce against high-risk listings.</p>

<p>This is just the first step in a greater strategic direction. Unilever want to build a connected ecosystem which gives all of its collaborators, third-party suppliers, and wider team a global hub, enabling the company to be agile and responsive as the e-commerce landscape continues to evolve. Incopro will be instrumental in helping to set this up.</p>



<p>Partnering with Incopro has given Unilever the ability to monitor activity across all digital channels and markets. Harnessing this data, the Unilever’s Brand Protection teams can collaborate together better and work alongside teams from the wider business, such as e-commerce and marketing functions.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-a-growing-issue-with-online-infringements-and-social-media-governance"><strong>A growing issue with online infringements and social media governance</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns mb-0">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Mondelēz recognized the need for a more coordinated approach to resolving infringements of its brands online. The company had previously established an effective process for tackling offline infringements but the scale of online infringement remained unknown.</p>



<p>Their Brand Protection team became aware of a marked increase in infringements of their brands on social media and marketplaces. They realized they did not have the capacity to resolve this issue efficiently.</p>



<p>Following a social media audit that took place in 2018, the Brand Protection team identified that they didn&#8217;t have a technology solution to detect infringements and the Consumer Experience team had no way of processing governance of social media accounts for Mondelēz  brands.</p>



<p>Social media accounts previously run by external agencies or internal regional teams were no longer under central control of Mondelēz and posed a risk to brand reputation. It was key that these accounts were either brought under central control or closed down so the brands’ messaging would be aligned and consumer experience would remain identical through any digital touchpoint.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>The business would also need to identify any unofficial accounts that were trying to affiliate themselves with the company and line them up for enforcement action.</p>

<div class="wp-block-columns mb-0">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Mondelēz approached the project as an internal exercise and sought to drive collaboration between the Consumer Experience, Brand Protection and Marketing Services teams.</p>



<p>These separate teams each needed a solution to slightly different problems but wanted a single service provider that delivered against all of them. Talisman, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Incopro’s Brand Protection platform</a>, was singled out as the technology solution that could achieve this.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Mondelēz recognized the amount of risk that online infringement and false association posed to consumers online. The company&#8217;s mantra throughout the process was to ensure that consumer trust in Mondelēz brands was at the heart of everything it did.</p>



<p>For Mondelēz, Online Brand Protection is about risk management. Incopro enables Mondelēz to quantify this risk, prioritize key areas in the digital customer experience, and to act accordingly to prevent reputational damage.</p>

<p>By working with Incopro, the Mondelēz team gained visibility of online activity that they weren&#8217;t previously aware of but that presented a significant risk to the business.</p>



<p>One example is the proliferation of vaping products, e-liquids, and cannabis edibles that are using Mondelēz brands. The team were aware on a low level of the existence of these types of products but were unable to ascertain the scale of the problem or where is was most concentrated.</p>



<p>Talisman was able to scrape the web at scale and present accurate data on the volume of infringement, enabling Mondelēz to build valuable intelligence and to shut this activity down.</p>
