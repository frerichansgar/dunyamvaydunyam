<p>The Air-Pot is a revolutionary horticulture container that has been developed, patented and trademarked by the Caledonian Tree Company. Now into its sixth generation, the container has been designed to guarantee healthy root development and maximize aeration. The Air-Pots last up to ten years, and the company ensures that they have the strongest sustainability credentials by making them from recycled plastic.</p>

<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>In the early 2000s, Caledonian Tree Company first noticed that they had a counterfeit issue coming out of China and as the popularity of their product grew, so did their infringement problem. The counterfeits they found were all about creating cheaply produced imitations of the Air-Pot that undercut the cost of the legitimate product.</p>



<p>These illegitimate listings are easily confused by consumers with genuine Air-Pots when making purchases online. Counterfeits that do make their way into the hands of unsuspecting, would-be consumers, can damage the goodwill and trust carefully built by the company over the last two decades.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>The imitations are not created with the recycled plastic that is so core to the appeal of Air-Pots, and they often get the important details of the pot wrong that make such a difference in the success of the product. Counterfeiters are unable to provide the expert advice that is supplied by either Caledonian Tree Company or one of their distributors which can play a critical role in the successful use of the product for first-time buyers.</p>



<h4 id="h-counterfeits-are-all-about-making-an-air-pot-people-can-buy-cheaper-than-ours-but-they-don-t-know-why-it-s-in-existence-and-they-don-t-know-how-to-advise-people-to-use-the-system">“Counterfeits are all about making an Air-Pot people can buy cheaper than ours, but they don’t know why it’s in existence and they don’t know how to advise people to use the system”</h4>

<h3 id="h-prior-to-partnering-with-incopro">Prior to partnering with Incopro </h3>



<p>Caledonian Tree Company attempted to stop the counterfeits internally. This meant staff members were having to spend time away from their regular roles to clear up online channels manually. However, with the scale of the internet and the volume of online marketplaces and websites, the problem was too large to fix without technology.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><img width="159" height="147" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/legal-action.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-663"/></figure></div>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3 id="h-by-partnering-with-incopro">By partnering with Incopro</h3>



<p>Caledonian Tree Company gained a holistic view of their problem and online channels. The results so far have shown a lasting significant impact on the problem with:</p>



<ul><li>over 1,400 marketplace listings taken down</li><li>content removed on over 60 websites</li><li>numerous social media posts removed</li></ul>



<p>This demonstrates how Incopro’s analysts have been able to disrupt the counterfeit behavior, most notably in China, and how their work has led to a drastic reduction in infringement on Caledonian Tree Company’s brand in the region and around the world.</p>
