<h2 class="has-text-align-center heading-branded">The evolution of online threats</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns mb-0">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>“I&#8217;ve been with Brompton for almost three years – in my time, the online environment has rapidly evolved. As a business, we&#8217;re looking more to direct-to-consumer channels, primarily through e-commerce and also through our physical store network” Millie says.</p>



<p>“Our channel strategy now reflects the importance of our partners’ e-commerce stores. Over the last five years our brand has rapidly expanded, and awareness has increased – which is fantastic. But with that awareness and demand, came counterfeiters and copycats jumping on that trend.”</p>



<p>“When I joined Brompton in 2019, I quickly witnessed huge demand coming out of the Asia-Pacific region. I very quickly flagged the problematic marketplaces and the infringements starting to crop up. And that was before I&#8217;d even really looked deeper, because at the time we didn&#8217;t have a brand protection program, nor a technology platform where we could understand the scope and scale of infringements.”</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center heading-branded"><strong>The threat to consumer safety and Brompton’s brand reputation</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns mb-0">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>“The Brompton community is incredibly engaged and they&#8217;re incredibly loyal. Our number one priority is to protect them” Millie explains.</p>



<p>Millie notes that the evolution of the online environment has led to threats to consumer safety and trust in the Brompton brand.</p>



<p>“Some of the key trends that we’ve identified with the help of Incopro [a Corsearch company] and Talisman [Incopro’s brand protection platform] include complete copycat bikes, bike parts that claim to be official Brompton products, and bike stickers.”</p>



<p>“Both our quality control and manufacturing are still done today in London, UK. We pride ourselves on the handmade quality craftsmanship in our bikes. Counterfeiters and copycats on the other hand use lower quality brazing or welds within the frame, poor quality materials, uncertified components, and lower quality manufacturing techniques – all putting consumers at risk. The safety aspect is quite scary. You could be riding down a hill on a copycat Brompton and suddenly the parts could fail – that could result in serious injury.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center heading-branded">Brompton’s approach to online brand protection</h2>



<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3>Prior to working with Incopro</h3>



<p>“Prior to working with Incopro we were very reactive and did not have a structured approach to online brand protection. We would respond with individual takedowns when a customer came into contact with either a marketplace listing or a social media profile” Millie explains.</p>



<p>“When I joined the business there was recognition that I had some background in brand protection. I quickly found out that the business was aware of infringements but had no effective way to deal with them at scale. I would personally enforce where I could, but that was not efficient or an effective use of my time. And it was not even scratching the surface of the problem.”</p>



<p>“We had underestimated the scale of the challenge. We didn&#8217;t have the technology to match keywords or images. Instead, a member of our team would search manually for infringements. I knew we needed to get a platform and a team like Incopro to set up image matching and keywords to identify infringements. The first step in the program for us was to audit and understand the scale of the issue.”</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3>Working in partnership with Incopro</h3>



<p>“There was a piece of education to our senior management around the value of brand protection platforms, the options available and the pricing models as well. There were several vendors considered. However, based on our prior experience of the platform itself and the capabilities that we could access with Talisman, it was far superior. So ultimately we chose Incopro” Millie says.</p>



<p>“By working with Incopro, we can identify risks and opportunities before we expand our e-commerce offering. In a particular market, we can audit threats or key platforms that may pose a risk, and we can proactively focus efforts in that region. This will allow us to reduce the volume of copycats or fraudulent sellers in that market before we officially enter.”</p>
</div>
</div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center heading-branded">Incopro’s analyst team acting as an extension of the Brompton team</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>“I knew that I wasn&#8217;t going to have capacity internally, so I needed an external team that could partner with us. Incopro’s analyst team acts as an extension of the Brompton team” Millie explains.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve got an inbox that our customer facing team can use to report infringements directly to Incopro. That allows our global staff members to report directly when they are alerted of new threats in the market. We also use the team to we work with them proactively to ensure that we&#8217;re focusing on high-risk products or high-risk territories. The team then assign risk rules in the system to identify infringing products within the territories that are of particular attention for us.”</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Millie highlights that the analyst team’s expertise allows Brompton to be more effective in its brand protection activity.</p>



<p>“We tap into the knowledge, the relationships, and the insights that Incopro has developed from representing so many brands globally in the brand protection space. They are able to advise us on our program and strategic efforts. The impact has been impressive.”</p>



<p>“Our quarterly success reviews allow us to tweak our direction. I bring in senior stakeholders across the Brompton business so we can align on the direction for the next quarter. The Incopro team also provides reports, which are fantastic for circulating internally – especially to the C-suite. So I really value this as it reduces the strain internally and ensures that we get consistent visibility for the brand protection program.”</p>
</div>
</div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center heading-branded" id="h-aligning-brand-protection-across-marketing-sales-e-commerce-legal"> Aligning brand protection across marketing, sales, e-commerce &amp; legal</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Being in the marketing space, Millie explains that brand protection delivers value to the wider business. Millie is able to share insights on issues such as digital hygiene and compliance with brand guidelines.</p>



<p>“We can detect activity across our global retail network and whitelist these results. This enables the analysts to focus their efforts on high-risk infringements. However, we can then use this whitelist data internally to identify non-compliance of our brand guidelines by our partners, such as outdated brand assets or logos. We can then moderate these assets to ensure the customer experience remains consistent.”</p>



<p>“Incopro enables us to build broader intelligence for other teams in the business to harness. This intelligence includes parallel imports and gray market goods, product availability in different territories, as well as general online brand activity. Our sales team can then investigate further and use these insights.”</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>“We&#8217;ve also been able to protect and prepare expansions for the brand. For example: if we were to expand into new markets where we do not already have a direct-to-consumer e-commerce offering, we can have the Incopro team perform an audit to assess key threats and opportunities. This helps us collaborate internally across sales, marketing, e-commerce.”</p>



<p>“Another key area where we use insights from the Incopro team is identifying risks to our IP portfolio. This enables our legal team to address gaps in our portfolio in key markets, allowing Brompton to stay ahead of copycats and increase enforcement compliance.”</p>
</div>
</div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group bg-primary--light"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<h2 class="heading-branded">Looking to the future of brand protection</h2>



<p>Millie explains that the business is looking to expand its brand protection strategy to social media, with the goals of both safeguarding its dedicated customer community and to streamline its authorized assets.</p>



<p>“We love our official community. They&#8217;re incredibly engaged, but we don&#8217;t want to risk unofficial pages or sites being created that might pose a threat to that community.”</p>



<p>“In the future, we want to look further than marketplace infringements and to audit both authorized and unauthorized Brompton social media accounts. This will help us ensure that our on-the-ground efforts aren&#8217;t diluted on social media, so our customers can find our official page when they search for it.”</p>



<p>“Social media auditing also has another key use case. We&#8217;ve recently undergone a complete overhaul of product hierarchy and have rebranded. That&#8217;s involved new product naming and innovation to our customer journey, which is a big step forward for Brompton. But that means we have a big task ahead of us to identify all uses of outdated assets that we’ve phased out. Incopro will be critical for that project because Talisman will be able to identify both outdated logos and product names, meaning we will be able to align our digital presence quickly.”</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center heading-branded">Brand protection issues for Arc&#8217;teryx</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3>Counterfeit listings</h3>



<p>Tom explains that online counterfeiting became a problem for Arc’teryx almost overnight.</p>



<p>“We started seeing significant counterfeiting about 12 or 13 years ago. It started more or less instantaneously – we&#8217;d not had a problem one day, and then the next week we had a huge problem on websites and marketplaces.”</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3>Social media advertising</h3>



<p>Online infringement has now expanded into social media, with counterfeiters using adverts to direct unsuspecting consumers to their websites, Tom says.</p>



<p>“We focus on blocking infringers’ advertising on social media because that&#8217;s possible in a relatively short period of time, whereas it can be difficult to get a website taken down without legal action, which costs money and time.”</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center heading-branded">Sophisticated counterfeits and the threat to brand reputation</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>“A lot of the techniques that have become industry standard over the last 20 years are those we invented. And so, in the early days of the counterfeits, they didn&#8217;t look like anything we made – they just featured our logo” Tom states.</p>



<p>“Over the last four years, counterfeiters have become more sophisticated, manufacturing products that look similar to the real-thing – while still using really cheap, sub-standard materials. We&#8217;ve had anecdotes of consumers having bought these fakes, believing they are real, only for teeth to fall out of the zipper when they take it out of the packaging.”</p>



<p>Tom explains the growing threat to brand reputation caused by more sophisticated counterfeits:</p>



<p>“We had one consumer who unintentionally bought a counterfeit skiing jacket and used it for several months. When the product became faulty, he wanted to return it to us thinking it was genuine. We asked the consumer to send us pictures of the garment before we accepted the warranty return, and we could see it was a fake.”</p>



<p>“What hit me about these scenarios is that a consumer could use a counterfeit for almost a year, believing it was genuine, and think ‘<em>It wasn&#8217;t bad, but it was nothing to write home about. I don&#8217;t see how they could ever charge $800. I&#8217;m glad I only paid $100.’</em> That&#8217;s a real concern.”</p>

<h3>Choosing Incopro as a brand protection vendor</h3>



<p>“We started using a firm for online enforcement around 2010. In those days, we were primarily concerned about the eBays and Amazons of the world. We used this firm for three years but found that these takedowns didn&#8217;t actually stay put and that some didn’t even happen in the first place” explains Tom.</p>



<p>“Subsequently we moved to another provider. They largely looked at marketplaces, but websites were also becoming an issue for us. We stayed with that provider for about six years. However, we were still playing whack-a-mole. And, of course, that always remains to a certain extent part of the game, but we were not seeing results. So, we took a step back and thought about it a little more carefully. We then decided to look for a new vendor.”</p>



<p>“We looked at four different vendors, including our current provider, but ended up choosing Incopro due to their technology and competitive pricing. We liked the look of Talisman [Incopro’s brand protection platform] and felt it would give better visibility at my level, not just to Incopro’s analysts. We also saw opportunities to use Talisman’s network analysis functionality to collect information on networks of counterfeiters.”</p>

<h3>Incopro’s data facilitates raids and criminal prosecutions</h3>



<p>“In 2019, our group was sold to a consortium that included the Chinese firm Anta. With that came connections to their brand protection team in China. We now take action on the ground in China to shut down counterfeiting operations and pursue criminal charges against them” Tom states.</p>



<p>“Incopro’s platform has been really helpful for that, and the analysts in the Shanghai office work closely with our parent company. They gather information on networks of counterfeiters who are selling on Taobao or other Chinese marketplaces and pass that on, rather than sending takedown notices immediately – this is so we don’t alert the counterfeiter that we&#8217;re actively investigating them.”</p>



<p>“Anta then investigates further to find out where the counterfeiter’s factories or warehouses are located and then pursues criminal charges. And we&#8217;ve been successful with this approach – initiating a number of raids against counterfeiting operations, with successful prosecutions following up. Compared to 2019, raids have increased by a factor of <strong>20</strong>.”</p>

<p>Incopro uses image matching technology to determine the illegitimate use of Arc’teryx’s copyright imagery. Analysts configure risk rules to automatically tag infringements based on image matching and price information.</p>



<p>“We use Incopro’s image technology as the first line of defence against counterfeiters – as we can easily identify them using copyrighted photos. Incopro’s analyst team maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date image library to help us discover illegitimate sellers on key platforms such as Amazon” Tom explains.</p>
