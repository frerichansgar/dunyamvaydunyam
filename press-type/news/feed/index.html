<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Corsearch and Incopro Join Forces to Support a Cleaner Internet and a Better Society</strong></p>



<p><em>As eCommerce and digital content boom, Corsearch and Incopro will create a global team capable of restoring trust against counterfeiting, brand abuse, and piracy</em></p>



<p><strong>LONDON, (June 10 2021) </strong>&#8212;&nbsp;Corsearch&nbsp;is pleased to announce the acquisition of the online brand protection provider,&nbsp;Incopro, in a deal which&nbsp;further enhances&nbsp;Corsearch&#8217;s&nbsp;brand and content protection capabilities.&nbsp;Like&nbsp;Corsearch,&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;is an agile and innovative company that has pioneered new technologies to meet the increasing challenges of a complex online environment.&nbsp;Incopro’s&nbsp;technology-enabled team protects more than 750 brands from counterfeiting and IP abuse&nbsp;and&nbsp;the combination&nbsp;of the two companies&nbsp;reflects a commitment to further developing and delivering the solutions that brands and IP businesses need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dramatic growth of eCommerce and digital media consumption mean that companies and consumers now rely on the Internet more than ever.

<p><em>Study finds that infringements could be reduced by up to 24% with a &#8216;three strikes&#8217; ban that stops aggressive repeat offenders across major online marketplaces and social sites</em> </p>



<p><strong>April&nbsp;</strong><strong>22</strong><strong>, 2021, LO</strong><strong>NDON and LO</strong><strong>S ANGELES &#8212;&nbsp;</strong>A new study released today by online brand&nbsp;protection software provider, <a href="http://www.incoproip.com/%22%20/o%20%22http://www.incoproip.com%22%20/t%20%22_blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incopro,</a> has found that a core group of repeat sellers are responsible for a disproportionate share of illicit activity on online marketplaces and social sites. In the study,&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;analyzed more than 1.5 million automated requests, sent on behalf of 750+ brands between November 2019 and November 2020, asking for illicit offers for sale to be removed across 34 global marketplaces and social sites.&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;found that one in five of its automated requests to remove fake listings related to 3% of illicit sellers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the report, titled: <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/three-strikes-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Three Strikes and Out: How Ecommerce Platforms Can Protect Consumers from Repeat Offenders,“</a> Incopro&nbsp;also explores the connection between repeat sellers of illicit goods and services and the monetary gain that could be secured if online marketplaces and social sites were to implement two baseline requirements: (1) all seller identities should be verified; and (2) all sellers should be removed from the marketplace or social site if identified as selling illicit goods and services on more than three occasions (&#8220;three strikes&#8221;). Implementing a uniform approach could significantly reduce illicit sales and save up to $78B of losses annually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;With the pandemic driving an accelerated shift to online retail, it is critical that more is done to protect brands and consumers,&#8221; said Simon&nbsp;Baggs, CEO and co-founder of&nbsp;Incopro. &#8220;We are seeing huge increases in brand misuse, a trend which has already caught the eye of legislators in the United States and Europe. I hope this study will inform and accelerate legislative change, driving a consistent approach to seller verification and sanctions for repeat illicit activity.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to&nbsp;Incopro&#8217;s&nbsp;study:&nbsp;</p>



<p>·     The most aggressive, repeated use of ecommerce operations to infringe rights and harm consumers comes from only 3% of illicit sellers.&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;defined this group as sellers whose listings have been flagged to online platforms on more than three separate days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>·     21% of all the removal requests sent to online platforms by&nbsp;Incopro&nbsp;concerned the most aggressive group of repeat illicit sellers; hence, one out of five illicit offers for sale are generated by a core of 3% of wrongdoers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>·     Currently, 68% of the online marketplaces and social sites analyzed (23 of 34) have some policy in place to tackle repeat sellers of illegitimate goods; however, only three of these platforms have publicly announced, strict &#8220;three strikes&#8221; policies that consistently result in banning repeat illicit sellers:&nbsp;Alibaba,&nbsp;Aliexpress, and&nbsp;Taobao.&nbsp;</p>



<p>·     A minimum of 11% of all harmful online offers could be stopped immediately if robust seller verification was combined with a consistently implemented &#8220;three strikes&#8221; model (i.e., banning flagged sellers after three separate days of enforcement). This figure rises to 24% if the removal policy were applied more strictly (i.e., banning sellers after three non-genuine listings).&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hzjb9c/global_brand?w=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Global Brand Counterfeiting Report,</a> monetary losses suffered by the public due to online counterfeiting are estimated at $323B annually. If consumers are exposed to 11% fewer non-genuine offers on ecommerce platforms worldwide (per&nbsp;Incopro&#8217;s&nbsp;findings above), this would amount to $35B saved &#8212; and $78B saved with stricter policies. The equivalent revenue would also be captured by the true rights holders selling legitimate products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Added&nbsp;Baggs: &#8220;Nearly two thirds of consumers lose trust in a marketplace after being deceived by a counterfeit seller, according to a recent&nbsp;Incopro <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/news/2-out-of-3-consumers-believe-that-brands-are-responsible-for-protecting-them-from-fake-products-and-misleading-marketing-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumer survey.</a> Platforms have much to gain from instituting stricter measures that lead to the removal of repeat sellers of illicit goods and services, including a reduced admin workload and increased trust in their own brands.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/three-strikes-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> full report</a> is now available for download at <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.incoproip.com/reports/</a>. Incopro will also host a <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/events-and-webinars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">webinar</a> to address the research findings in the coming weeks. </p>

<p><em>Research findings support that protecting brand authenticity is becoming a critical element of consumer engagement</em></p>



<p><strong>December 16, 2020, LOS ANGELES and LONDON &#8212;&nbsp;</strong>A new consumer survey released today by online brand protection software provider,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.incoproip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incopro</a>, delves into shopper perspectives on the role that brand authenticity plays in their decision-making process in time for the holiday season and looking ahead to 2021. The findings also have implications for brands in terms of how to market their products in a way that nurtures a sense of the original, builds trust, and retains customers while growing market share. The survey was conducted with 2,000 U.S. respondents in November 2020, in partnership with marketing research firm, Savanta.</p>



<p>&#8220;With online shopping at an all-time high, and consumers on the lookout for holiday deals, we wanted to run this survey to take the pulse of where brand authenticity stands with consumers today,&#8221; said Piers Barclay, chief strategy officer at Incopro. &#8220;Having worked with hundreds of leading consumer brands, we have seen the damage counterfeit goods and other scams can cause. We have also seen the speed at which bad actors, such as counterfeiters, impersonators, and copycats, react to new opportunities that arise as consumers move online. Our research has demonstrated, not only that brand authenticity is vital to consumers, but also that many consumers view this area as the brand&#8217;s responsibility.&#8221;</p>



<p>The shift online, coupled with minimal or non-existent regulation for e-commerce, search and social platforms, has led to an explosion in fake goods and inauthentic brand experiences. The rise of ‘insta-shopping’ and the ability of malicious actors to replicate complete brand experiences means that trust in brands is more at risk than ever before. While no brand can control all of the content that consumers are exposed to in their name, establishing where to act and how stresses the importance of gaining a comprehensive view of “what’s out there” – from the customers’ vantage point. Incopro&#8217;s new consumer survey found that:</p>



<ul><li><strong>U.S. shoppers continue to run into fakes on the Internet&nbsp;</strong>– Approximately a quarter (24%) of U.S. consumers reported that they have been sold counterfeit products. More than a third (36%) have experienced fake ads or social posts, while 41% have come across fake websites and 35% noted fake social media accounts.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Brand reputations can be significantly impacted when they are targeted by counterfeiters</strong>&nbsp;– Three out of four U.S. consumers, (73%) said they would be put off by a brand after unwittingly buying fake products. And 63% said that simply Googling and landing on a fake web page would taint the brand in their eyes. The vast majority (79%) of respondents said it was either very or extremely important for brands to feel real and authentic.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Consumers believe that fakes are a problem</strong>&nbsp;–60% of respondents said that they agree with this statement. 71% are concerned about counterfeit goods feeding into criminal activity.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Brands are responsible for the public’s protection from counterfeit goods</strong>&nbsp;– 69% of consumers surveyed believe that brands are responsible for protecting shoppers from fake versions of their products sold online, and 65% of respondents feel that brands are responsible for protecting them from fake marketing content (e.g., communications, websites, etc.). Additionally, 77% of consumers believe that brands are responsible for reporting fake social media accounts that impersonate them.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Consumers think that brands can do more about fakes&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; 71% of consumers believe that brands should be doing more to protect them from impersonating brands and phishing attacks. Only 33% of consumers see fraudulent products and content as an unavoidable part of today’s world.</li></ul>



<p>The survey findings reveal that brands are falling below consumer expectations in dealing with the counterfeit goods problem. They are looking to brands to do more and that may mean extending responsibility beyond legal and deeper into marketing departments.</p>



<p>“Marketers are responsible for consumer engagement and how consumers perceive their brands across every conceivable touchpoint,” added Barclay. “If more marketers become accountable for monitoring and stopping the threats to their brands&#8217; authenticity, we will see them deliver a truly outstanding experience. That’s why we are seeing growth in the number of marketers embracing protection as a new 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;“P” of marketing, alongside product, place, price and promotion.”</p>

<p>London, 2 November 2020. </p>



<p>Acamar Films has partnered with leading brand protection experts Incopro to ensure the safety of Bing products &amp; live events and safeguard the trust of consumers.</p>



<p>With the significant acceleration of the Bing licensing programme over the past 18 months, Acamar has acted to support licensees’ growth and sales of Bing products and associated activities.</p>



<p>Incopro will be expediently tackling counterfeit product and activity across marketplaces and platforms globally, using effective takedown and enforcement measures. This includes tracking the marketplace, identifying counterfeit goods being sold and then issuing take down notices to the respective sellers.</p>



<p>Sparked by the launch of a brand-new toy line by Bing’s Master Toy partner Golden Bear – whose award-winning AW19 Bing range was its fastest-selling in years – along with a rapid international growth strategy, the number of Bing licensees and available products has hugely increased in the last couple of years. Currently there are some 5,500 Bing products available across 60,000+ points of sale as Bing continues to move and delight Bingsters and their grown-ups.</p>



<p>Incopro has been working to make the internet a better place for businesses and their consumers since 2012. Their best-in-class Talisman platform uses highly sophisticated techniques to stay one step ahead of brand and e-commerce abuse, discovering and acting on infringing content and products.</p>



<p>Sandra Vauthier-Cellier, Chief Commercial Officer, Acamar Films, said: “At Acamar we are committed to protecting our brand and we take counterfeit and online threats very seriously. We want to support our licensees against copycats and infringers and ensure that our consumers can trust every online interaction with Bing. Teaming up with Incopro, with their vast global expertise and leading technology, enables us to give a much stronger guarantee of that.”</p>



<p>Piers Barclay, Chief Strategy Officer, Incopro, said: “We’re delighted to be partnering with Acamar Films to protect Bingsters from the risk of poor quality, unsafe counterfeits and the sadly growing number of threats to consumer trust online. We’re excited about the partnership ahead and that such a rapidly growing brand has joined our global community.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Now, more than ever, Incopro is both proud and determined to work in partnership with our customers.&nbsp;Our vision is to have the courage to create a world where consumers can trust every online interaction with a brand, and where businesses can invest in their brands without fear of copycats or infringers stealing their consumers and damaging the trust they’ve worked so hard to win.</p>



<p>To deliver our vision, we know that we must remain completely focused:</p>



<ul><li>combining our specialist expertise with excellent technology solutions</li></ul>



<ul><li>empowering our customers to <strong>discover and prioritize</strong> the biggest threats and <strong>work together</strong> to protect their consumers and their business.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Ingenuity and determination are key to delivery and I am delighted to have seen such tremendous efforts from our team this year.&nbsp;Here is a quick update on some of the latest initiatives that Incopro has taken forward:</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-discover" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>Discover</strong></h2>



<p>From an initial reliance on text only searching, our Talisman platform now deploys 3 different image recognition technologies to look online, discover and visualize more of the harms that consumers see.&nbsp;No brand is just a word, so we are focused on ensuring that we see our customer’s brands in full and as the eyes of the consumer.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-prioritize" style="color:#2858a5"><strong>Prioritize</strong></h2>



<p>We have released a new and powerful upgrade to our network analysis technology.&nbsp;Our customers can reveal even more hidden connections (using data including Google analytics, social media profiles and IP address data) to expose the bad actors running business level operations targeting brands and consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-better-together" style="color:#65b32e"><strong>Better together</strong></h2>



<p>United together, brands can better protect consumers and their business. To support this, we have combined our Network Analysis function with a data warehouse that brings together Talisman data as a whole dataset.&nbsp;This allows our analyst teams to discover the operations that are harming multiple brands, helping our customers to work together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also bringing brands together through INSYNC, a program that focuses on joint initiatives to further our vision through lobbying and collaboration. So far, the program has seen the publication of our White Paper on Google’s refusal to de-index counterfeits from search and a subsequent change in policy from the search engine. Furthermore, brands such as Adobe, Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser and Mondelēz have shared insights with over 1,000 different brand owners through our event and webinar series. We have more exciting developments to come.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-the-future"><strong>The Future</strong></h2>



<p>We will continue to invest in the technology and people that are essential to helping our customers work together to protect their consumers and their business. With this in mind, we are embarking on our road map planning for 2021 and we would love to hear from you with your insights on what technology you believe will help you to deliver more in protecting your business and your consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you would like to get in touch with me about this, my personal email address is <a href="mailto:simon.baggs@incoproip.com">simon.baggs@incoproip.com</a>.&nbsp;We will also be following up with you through our product and brand success teams in the coming months.</p>



<p>Thank you as always for your continued support.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Report examines emerging supply chain execution technologies for supply chain leaders.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/">Incopro,</a>&nbsp;leading enterprise brand protection supplier, has been named as a Sample Vendor in Gartner’s recent report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3987219/hype-cycle-for-supply-chain-execution-technologies-2020">Hype Cycle for Supply Chain Execution Technologies, 2020</a>(Gartner Subscription Required), published in July 2020 by Gartner Inc.</p>



<p>In the report, Gartner VP Analyst, Dwight Klappich states: “The new generation of more scalable and integrated anti-counterfeiting technologies are beginning to meet increasing demands for greater levels of innovation and digitalization. They also are starting to evolve to meet and exceed expectations demanded by end users as part of market and brand protection strategies. Solution innovation is also continually being shaped by ever-increasing levels of sophistication and diversification in the quality and production and the delivery mechanism of counterfeit, fake, falsified or substandard products, data and information.”</p>



<p>Incopro provides solutions to monitor for and remediate threats to brands online, from counterfeits to social media impersonation, phishing scams, fake domains and other forms of brand abuse. It combines legal and criminal intelligence expertise to drive innovation in its Talisman platform and ensure that increasingly sophisticated counterfeiters cannot avoid detection.</p>



<p>Gartner advises: “Anti-counterfeiting deployments should be managed through collaboration across impacted stakeholders in the supply chain.” In our opinion, this recommendation is in line with Incopro’s focus on the importance of cross-functional collaboration to gain maximum value from brand protection investments.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to be recognized by Gartner, we believe this recognition is validation for the value that our solutions can offer to Supply Chain leaders in the fight against counterfeits,” commented Piers Barclay, Chief Strategy Officer of Incopro. “By using our services, businesses are able to gain visibility and control of their brand online and help protect consumers from the dangers of counterfeits.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>One in five Brits are intentionally buying counterfeits despite fear over organised crime</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Nearly one in five (19%) UK consumers have intentionally picked out counterfeit goods in the last 12 months</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Latest research shows Brits are still buying fakes despite their biggest concerns being the links to organised crime (28%)</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>05 December 2019, London</strong><strong>:</strong> As the countdown to Christmas begins, UK consumers are looking for the best deals for the latest presents, and not always from reputable sellers. In fact, new research has discovered that one in five Brits have knowingly chosen fake goods, with over a third (36%) of those people purchasing more than 4 in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>The research published today from online brand protection software provider Incopro, has shown that there is a huge appetite for these often-cheaper illegal alternatives when 28% of UK consumers would consider buying fake watches, footwear, clothing, handbags/purses and jewellery from online counterfeit resellers.</p>
<p>The pressure to buy the latest designer items for loved ones this Christmas is leading consumers to actively seek out fake goods online. Whilst they might think they’re getting a good deal and it’s not hurting anyone, the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO)[1] has stated that financial intelligence has helped identify numerous international organised crime groups (OCG) who have made multi-millions of pounds through the sale of counterfeit goods.</p>
<p>Despite the willingness from consumers to get fakes of the latest products to put in their stockings this Christmas, over a third of UK consumers (37%) want law enforcement authorities and the police to do more to stop the sale of counterfeit goods online.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it is younger people who are calling on brands themselves to take the responsibility to stop fakes making their way into homes, with 27% of 18-24 year olds listing</p>
<p>them as needing to do more. With nearly half of those in that category (48%) saying they have lost trust in a brand after purchasing a counterfeit</p>
<p><strong>Piers Barclays, Chief Strategy Officer at Incopro said, “</strong>With the shopping peak upon us, the risks of counterfeit activity are amplified as online shoppers seek out deals this holiday season. Our research shows that some consumers are regularly being tricked into buying counterfeit goods. However, more shockingly the volume of consumers who are happy to ignore the links between counterfeiting and organised crime, making the conscious decision to purchase fake products, shows the importance of collaboration between brands, platforms and authorities to stop infringers and prevent this societal harm.”</p>
<p>The results are part of a combined UK &amp; US research project that explores the impact of today’s ‘Fake Society’. In the report, results reveal how consumer trust is impacted and whether we know – or even care &#8211; that we are purchasing fake goods.</p>
<p>The findings highlight that UK consumers are well aware of the risks posed by fake pharmaceuticals, with 44% believing they pose the biggest threat to society. On the contrary, they are ignoring the risks that come with buying fake fashion items with only 13% listing the knock-on effects of the ‘knock-offs’, as the biggest threat.</p>
<p>The lack of consumer education when it comes to fake goods appears pertinent when even more (22%) consumers have unknowingly purchased counterfeit items online in the previous 12 months, a large amount of which (18%) have lost over £100 on fake goods.</p>
<p>It is clear the UK is suffering from a counterfeit pandemic and consumers need to be educated in both how to spot a fake but also the problems they cause to wider society. Everyone must take more responsibility in this scenario, with further recent Incopro research discovering that <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/how-and-why-search-engines-must-take-responsibility-for-tackling-counterfeiters">six in 10 Google search results lead online shoppers to fake goods.</a></p>
</p>
<p><strong>Nathalie Nahai, Web Psychologist, author and award-winning speaker comments:</strong><br /> “ The research suggests that changing consumer preferences are pressuring brands and platforms (whether ecommerce or social) to meet evolving expectations, by taking greater action to flag genuine goods, limit the propagation of fake items / content, and take responsibility swiftly and with integrity when issues arise.”<br /> <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-uk">Read the full research findings here </a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Incopro releases survey findings on what is driving growth of online market for counterfeit goods</h2>
<h3>32% of U.S. consumers believe online marketplaces should be doing more to stop the purchase of fake products</h3>
<p><strong>December 5, 2019, LOS ANGELES &#8212;</strong> Consumers are looking for the best holiday deals on fashion items, electronics, and more, but not always from reputable sellers. Online brand protection software provider Incopro, in partnership with Sapio Research, conducted a survey with 1,059 U.S. respondents in October 2019 to understand how consumers are influenced online, and whether they know – or care &#8211; that they are being tricked. The report, released today, sheds a light on consumer habits in researching and purchasing products on the Internet as well as what drives consumers to buy counterfeit goods, both unwillingly and by choice. Additionally, the survey findings show the impact of counterfeit goods on brand reputation and consumer perceptions on who should be held accountable.</p>
<p><strong>Piers Barclay, Chief Strategy Officer of Incopro</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;With the shopping peak upon us, the risks of counterfeit activity are amplified as online shoppers seek out deals this holiday season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research shows that some consumers are regularly being tricked into buying counterfeit goods while others are making the conscious decision to purchase fake products, which can be unsafe and/or contribute to funding criminal networks. Consumer education and leadership on this matter is needed from public influencers, including online marketplaces, policymakers, brands, and search engines, to avoid a deeper plunge into the abyss of the black market.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Incopro&#8217;s survey findings in the U.S. include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>26% of respondents have been fooled into buying at least one counterfeit product in the past 12 months. The median amount mistakenly spent on fake products is $69 per person. More than a quarter (27%) of respondents never received a refund from an online marketplace despite reporting a seller of counterfeit goods.</li>
<li>One in two U.S. consumers (52%) have lost trust in a brand after unintentionally purchasing counterfeit products online.</li>
<li>32% of U.S. consumers believe online marketplaces should be doing more to stop the purchase of counterfeit goods. Sears is the most trusted online marketplace while eBay and Wish are the least trusted online marketplaces for buying genuine goods.</li>
<li>When asked which fakes pose the biggest threat to society online 34% said fake pharmaceuticals.</li>
<li>Almost one in five consumers (18%) don’t care that a trade war with China would mean more counterfeit goods becoming available online. While it is concerning that one in seven (15%) actually see more fake goods being available as a good thing.</li>
<li>32% answered &#8220;yes, definitely&#8221; or &#8220;yes, maybe&#8221; to willingly buying fake clothing, fake leather goods, and fake jewelry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nationwide, counterfeiting has been receiving significant attention lately, ranging from calls from President Trump to address the counterfeit goods problem to senators writing letters to Amazon to remove illegal, deadly, and deceptive products, sold on the platform. Most recently, in November 2019, the Senate Finance Committee released a bipartisan report, titled “<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Fight%20Against%20Fakes%20%20(2019-11-07).pdf">The Fight Against Fakes: How Statutory and Regulatory Barriers Prevent The Sharing of Information on Counterfeits</a>, which underscores the challenges rights holders have in enforcing their intellectual property online and many of the health and safety risks of counterfeits sold online. However, according to Incopro&#8217;s survey, almost a third of the respondents (31%) want the U.S. government to do more to stop the sale of counterfeit goods online.</p>
<p><strong>Nathalie Nahai, Web Psychologist, author and award-winning speaker comments:</strong><br /> “ The research suggests that changing consumer preferences are pressuring brands and platforms (whether ecommerce or social) to meet evolving expectations, by taking greater action to flag genuine goods, limit the propagation of fake items / content, and take responsibility swiftly and with integrity when issues arise.”<br /> <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us">Read the full research findings here</a></p>
<p>Incopro and Sapio Research also conducted a similar survey in the U.K. during the same October 2019 timeframe, the findings of which were also <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-uk">released today.</a> Some analogous trends were noted, including parallels with shopping and purchasing habits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A third of “gold” jewellery sold online in the UK is suspected to be fake, warns the British Hallmarking Council</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online consumers of gold jewellery are being duped by internet traders, according to new research conducted by WRi Group and Incopro on behalf of the British Hallmarking Council </strong></li>
<li><strong>British Hallmarking Council and Goldsmiths’ Company Assay Office call on the Government and internet giants to protect UK consumers by enforcing online trade</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MONDAY, 4</strong><strong>TH</strong><strong> NOVEMBER: </strong>New research conducted by WRi Group in partnership with Incopro on behalf of the British Hallmarking Council shows that a third of “gold” jewellery being sold online is suspected to be unhallmarked and therefore may be fake, raising concerns that UK consumers are being duped by internet traders.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/company/today/press/bhc/">https://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/company/today/press/bhc/</a></p>
<p>The research which took the form of a 10-day internet sweep revealed that 36% (6,377 from a total of 17,657) of “gold” jewellery listings on sites such as Amazon and Preloved had not been advertised as hallmarked. Of those listings, 24% (4,278) were suspected as fake and therefore being sold illegally. eBay sellers alone accounted for over half (56%) of all suspect items of “gold” jewellery being sold online, where there was no mention of a hallmark, between 21 March and 1 April 2019.</p>
<p>Clear links were also found to physical retail premises where some of the items available on-line were being sold in large numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Noel Hunter, Chairman of the British Hallmarking Council, says:</strong> “The UK Hallmarking Act (1973) was put in place to protect consumers and retail jewellers from counterfeits, but the application of the legislation to online trading activity remains untested. And we have seen little appetite from the internet giants to step up enforcement or adequately protect consumers.</p>
<p>“Our internet sweep highlights just a fraction of the infringements made by online sellers of ‘precious metal jewellery’ in the UK today. A duty of enforcement currently rests with local Trading Standards departments, who have suffered a 50% cut in their resources over the last five years. Adequate powers are necessary to deal with internet trade.”</p>
<p><strong>Gareth Mogg, Director at WRi Group said: ‘</strong>Our joint research with Incopro for this campaign provides a snapshot of the scale of the problem facing legitimate business and consumers from the trade in ‘fake’ gold jewellery. The use of on-line platforms to distribute these items is an on-going challenge for the law enforcement community and the only way to mitigate the threat is by industry, law enforcement, in this case Trading Standards, and the public to work in partnership to protect both the local and wider UK economy.</p>
<p><strong>Piers Barclay, Chief Strategy Officer at Incopro, added: ‘</strong>Many online marketplaces have publicised the programmes they have put in place to protect consumers from fake goods and counterfeits, but these often seem more like paying lip service to the issue than a genuine effort to stop the problem. The evidence collected here clearly demonstrates how prevalent the issue is and how more needs to be done to ensure that laws that apply offline are enforced online as well.’</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE RESEARCH</strong></p>
<p>The online insight report was conducted by WRi Group in partnership with Incopro – both brand protection agencies – on behalf of the British Hallmarking Council and the Goldsmiths’ Company Assay Office. Insights were drawn from online monitoring of UK marketplaces (Amazon, Depop, eBay, Freeadsd, Fruugo, Gumtree, PostAdsUK and Preloved) and social media (Facebook and Instagram) for 10 days from 21/03/2019 to 01/04/2019. The research ONLY looked at items sold as “gold”. It did not include other precious metal items.</p>
<p>The research looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many items are sold as “gold” without a hallmark being referenced in the title or the text of a listing or post. This excluded gold –plated, rolled, golden, coated, bonded, vintage; items pre-1950. And focused on products; bracelet, chain, necklace, ring.</li>
<li>How many “gold” items are sold as bearing a UK hallmark, but where a price would indicate that this is too low.</li>
<li>How many items are sold as bearing a hallmark accepted in the UK.</li>
</ul>
<p>The research found:</p>
<ul>
<li>11,280 listings for products where a hallmark had been detected</li>
<li>6,377 listings for products where a hallmark had not been detected</li>
<li>135 listings for products being sold with a non-UK Hallmark detected</li>
<li>4,278 suspected infringing items for sale</li>
<li>2,893 suspected infringing listings on the top UK platforms for less than 50% RRP</li>
<li>**£1,143,383 potential infringer revenue from suspicious listings. This was calculated by applying the value of scrap gold to the 6,377 listings for products where a hallmark had not been detected and the 135 listings for products being sold with a non-UK Hallmark detected.</li>
<li>And that sellers on eBay accounted for over half (56%) of all gold jewellery being sold, with no mention of a hallmark in the listing</li>
</ul>
<p>The report also looked at suspiciously priced hallmarked items – those at 50% or less of RRP – and found possible counterfeiting activities of several types of jewellery:</p>

<p><strong>W</strong><strong>HAT IS A HALLMARK?</strong></p>
<p>Official hallmarking is the trusted way to guarantee that you are getting the correct purity of precious metals in your jewellery. In the UK, all jewellery that is sold as having been made with gold, silver, platinum or palladium, must be hallmarked according to the Hallmarking Act 1973. *The hallmarking law exempts precious metal objects that weigh under a certain number of grams. This could mean small jewellery items like stud earrings or pendants. Jewellery does not have to be hallmarked if it weighs under:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 gram for gold</strong></li>
<li><strong>5 gram for platinum &amp; palladium </strong></li>
<li><strong>78 grams for silver</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Only jewellery that carries an officially registered British or international hallmark can be sold in the UK. A hallmark will usually include the Assay Office town mark, together with 2-4 additional marks, such as a date letter, a metal standard symbol or a duty stamp. There are hundreds of registered hallmark elements.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>THE GOLDSMITHS’ COMPANY ASSAY OFFICE</strong></p>
<p>The Goldsmiths’ Company Assay Office is a part of the Goldsmiths’ Company which was founded to regulate the craft and trade of the goldsmith and received its first Royal Charter in 1327. One of the twelve Great Livery Companies of the City of London, the Goldsmiths&#8217; Company has been responsible since 1300 for testing the quality of gold, silver and, from 1975, platinum articles.</p>
<p>The word hallmark originates from the fifteenth century when London craftsmen were first required to bring their artefacts to Goldsmiths&#8217; Hall for assaying and marking. Seven hundred years later the leopard’s head, the symbol of the Goldsmiths’ Company Assay Office, remains the premier hallmark in the country and is recognised internationally as a stamp of approval from the renowned home of hallmarking.</p>
<p>Today, the Goldsmiths’ Company Assay Office continues the tradition of guaranteeing the level of precious metal content in line with UK law. In addition, the Assay Office offers expert knowledge to authorities including Trading Standards and the police helping them to enforce the Hallmarking Act 1973.</p>
<p>Based at Goldsmiths’ Hall in the City of London, GCAO also operates through two other locations for the convenience of the client – in the centre of London’s Hatton Garden, to benefit those members of the trade based there, and at Heathrow, providing a quick and cost-effective turnaround on assaying imported goods.</p>
<p>The other Assay Offices in the UK are in Birmingham, Edinburgh and Sheffield.</p>
