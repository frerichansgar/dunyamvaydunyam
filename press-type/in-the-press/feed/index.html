<p>Though online marketplaces like Amazon may have helped make shopping easier, it can often be difficult to tell if what you are getting is the real thing or not.</p>



<p>People spent $861.1 billion shopping online with U.S. retailers last year, up 44 percent from the year before thanks to the pandemic per&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2021/02/15/ecommerce-during-coronavirus-pandemic-in-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Commerce 360</a>. With the online shopping boom comes more opportunities to make money off fake items. While high price point items like fake watches and handbags have always been popular, cheaper things like hand sanitizer and masks have also increased in prevalence. &#8220;Counterfeit items respond to changes in consumer behavior,&#8221; said brand protection company Incopro CEO Simon Baggs. &#8220;What&#8217;s selling is what people are searching for.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, it seems that the majority of fake items may be coming from the same sellers without anything to stop them. Incopro looked at more than 1.5 million IP infringement notices automatically filed on behalf of over 750 brands on 34 different online marketplaces including Alibaba, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter from November 2019 to November 2020. Overall, it estimates companies lose about $320 billion annually on consumers purchasing illicit goods, whether they know it or not.</p>

<p>If a rising tide lifts all boats, that must also apply to counterfeit products on ecommerce and social sites. What happens when digital advertising gets thrown into the mix to sell the counterfeit products?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecommerce became one of the fastest-growing segments for retail in North America and Europe in 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for goods and services, many unattainable in brick-and-mortar stores.</p>



<p>U.S. sales from ecommerce in 2020 were estimated to reach $794.5 billion &#8212; up 32% year-on-year, according to eMarketer.</p>



<p>As ecommerce continues to grow, it is estimated that the global, economic value of counterfeiting and piracy could reach $4.2 trillion by 2022, placing 5.4 million legitimate jobs at risk during the same period, according to a study released by Incopro.</p>



<p>&#8220;While we regularly hear from brands that repeat offenders are a challenge, we were surprised by the scale of issues that are driven by a small proportion of offenders, with only 3% of the most egregious offenders responsible for over 20% of issues,&#8221; said Piers Barclay, chief strategy&nbsp;officer at Incopro.</p>

<p>The footwear and clothing industries remain the most impacted by counterfeiting across the globe, making up <strong>22% </strong>and <strong>16% </strong>of total value of seizures respectively (Source: OECD). And fashion&nbsp;and&nbsp;beauty counterfeits&nbsp;have surged during COVID-19, as brand exploiters have taken advantage of new, less savvy online consumers.</p>



<p>This issue is only compounded during e-commerce events such as Black Friday. In the week of Thanksgiving / run up to Black Friday / Cyber Monday 2020, compared to a week 3 months back, Incopro’s technology detected:</p>



<ul><li><strong>155%</strong>&nbsp;growth of high-risk listings on eBay for a watch/jewelry retailer</li><li><strong>121%</strong>&nbsp;increase in high-risk listings on Amazon for a luxury brand</li><li><strong>51%</strong>&nbsp;increase in high-risk listings on Amazon for a streetwear brand</li></ul>



<p>But what can brands do to stop this?</p>



<p>Incopro Senior Legal Counsel <strong>Mike Sweeney</strong> joined Vogue Business&#8217; webinar: “The Counterfeiter Surge and How to Avoid It&#8221; on 4 December, sharing his insights on how fashion and clothing brands can better protect consumers and brand value online.</p>

<p>The explosion of e-commerce over the last year has been a godsend for brands and retailers that are struggling with store closures, but it comes with its own set of risks. For one, the combination of e-commerce growth and the holiday shopping rush has led to a significant increase in the amount of counterfeit goods being sold in the U.S.</p>



<p>According to data from brand protection agency Incopro, Black Friday saw a rise in the amount of counterfeits across sectors and platforms. EBay’s watch and jewelry category saw a 155% increase in high-risk listings (identified by Incopro’s fake-spotting algorithm) at select brands. On Amazon, some luxury goods saw a 121% increase in high risk listings and a 51% increase was flagged for some streetwear brands sold on the platform. Black Friday typically sees a growth in counterfeits being sold every year. Last year, there was a 156% increase in cosmetics counterfeits on Amazon from October to November, driven primarily by sellers in the space looking to bank off Black Friday sales.</p>



<p>“E-commerce has exploded this year, particularly around the holidays, and counterfeiters know this,” said Piers Barclay, chief strategy officer at Incopro. “In many ways, the counterfeiters are businesspeople, just like anyone else. So where there’s a lot of growth, that’s where they’ll be. Twenty years ago, counterfeiting was about selling something on the street corner. But the explosion of e-commerce and platforms like eBay has made it a lot easier.”</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Customers who fail to comply with the new rule could be fined up to £100</strong></p>



<p>Retailers in England have said the number of customers wearing a face covering has increased since the law was implemented last Friday, but some challenges remain.</p>



<p>From 24 July,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.betterretailing.com/legislation-competition/face-mask-rule-in-shops-rolled-out-in-england-but-how-will-it-be-policed/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the government enforced new legislation making it mandatory to wear face masks in enclosed public spaces</a>. Those who fail to comply could be fined up to £100, or £50 if they pay within 14 days.</p>



<p>The same rule has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.betterretailing.com/legislation-competition/retailers-react-to-new-mandatory-face-covering-law-in-scotland/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">active in Scotland since 10 July</a>.</p>



<h4><strong>Public response</strong></h4>



<p>Despite concerns over customer dissatisfaction or potential conflicts,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.betterretailing.com/news/stores-express-relief-at-pleasantly-surprising-start-to-face-mask-friday/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">retailers told betterRetailing they were “pleasantly surprised” the first morning of trading when the law came into effect</a>.</p>



<p>Jacqui Dales, of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.betterretailing.com/store-profiles/spar-london-road-bakery-boston/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">London Road Bakery in Boston, Lincolnshire</a>, said she had been “dreading the day”, but it was “much better than expected”.</p>



<p>“Probably more than 80% of customers have come in with masks on, and the others have either bought a mask from us or they’ve pulled a T-shirt up over their face,” she said.</p>



<p>Nearly a week on, Samantha Coldbeck, of <a href="https://www.betterretailing.com/symbol-group-wholesale/premier/following-the-living-wage-increase-were-performing-better-than-before/">Wharfedale Premier Co</a><a href="https://www.betterretailing.com/symbol-group-wholesale/premier/following-the-living-wage-increase-were-performing-better-than-before/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">n</a><a href="https://www.betterretailing.com/symbol-group-wholesale/premier/following-the-living-wage-increase-were-performing-better-than-before/">venience in Hull</a>, explained: “I would say nearly 90% of my customers are now wearing them. On Friday, it was mixed, but over the weekend we noticed an increase.”</p>



<p>Her staff have been wearing visors on the shop floor to help encourage compliance.</p>



<p>“Retailers can enforce the law without challenging people,” she said. “Last week, our staff started wearing shields to give a really strong message, and express that all we are asking from them is to keep us and themselves safe.”</p>



<h4><strong>Exemption challenges</strong></h4>



<p>Retailers said exemptions are making it difficult to police the rule.</p>



<p>Those exempt include children aged under 11; those with a physical or mental illness, or a disability; people for whom wearing or removing a mask will cause severe distress; and anyone assisting someone who relies on lip reading to communicate.</p>



<p>Scottish retailer Hussan Lal told betterRetailing: “It’s really difficult to enforce the rule when people may have a legitimate reason for not wearing a mask. I don’t really know how to have a conversation about it with them because it’s very personal.”</p>



<p>When asked how retailers should handle customers who are exempt, <a href="https://www.betterretailing.com/category/trade-organisations/acs/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACS</a> chief executive James Lowman responded: “This is a system that is built on trust between members of the public and store colleagues, and it is important to remember that some customers may be unable to wear a face covering for a variety of reasons, such as those related to health or communication.”</p>



<p>Coldbeck added that she has provided some of her customers with a hidden disability identification card. “I have only paid for one of these for my loyal customers, but I want them to know we support them,” she said.</p>



<h4><strong>Illicit fears</strong></h4>



<p>Chief strategy officer for counterfeit experts&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/">Incopro</a>, Piers Barclay, said he has seen an “explosion of counterfeit personal protective equipment (PPE) and products” due to recent increased demand.</p>



<p>Research by the company revealed that 66% of the first-page results for ‘surgical face mask’ on Google are illegitimate websites, and 45% of the first-page results for ‘surgical masks’ on Amazon UK have negative reviews relating to a false description or poor quality.</p>



<p>Barclay advised retailers to be cautious of buying PPE from suppliers they don’t recognise, and not to make purchases from sellers on social media.</p>



<p>Online cash and carry BrownBox began selling masks directly to independent stores in May, with orders delivered free by news wholesalers.</p>



<p>Founder Richard Lamb said: “Buy sensibly, and only from people with whom you have dealt with before. If you are wary, then you can request to see the certificates to prove the goods are legitimate.”</p>



<h4><strong>In-store dining</strong></h4>



<p>Customers are allowed to take off their masks to eat, drink or take medication, but retailer Mo Razzaq has been discouraging the use of his in-store dining area.</p>



<p>Owner of a <a href="https://www.betterretailing.com/store-profiles/family-shopper-blantyre/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Shopper in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire</a>, Razzaq told betterRetailing: “We’ve asked our customers not to sit in and eat, because it prevents more people being able to enter the store due to the limit.”</p>



<p>However, he has made disabled customers and emergency workers exempt from this.</p>



<p>“We want our customers to know we are mindful of how difficult this time has been for them,” he said.</p>

Image credit: Incopro</figcaption></figure>



<p>By&nbsp;Mike Sweeney</p>



<p>Legislative and regulatory pressure on Internet platforms is intensifying.</p>



<p>Initiatives such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/shop-safe-act-2020-cracks-down-on-counterfeits-on-ecommerce-platforms.html">Shop Safe Act</a>&nbsp;in the United States and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/digital-services-act-package">Digital Services Act</a>&nbsp;package of measures announced by the European Commission are aimed chiefly at enhancing platform accountability and, as such, are broadly welcomed by the luxury sector.</p>



<p>Brands and consumers seeking to confront threats on online platforms such as social media sites, ecommerce marketplaces and search engines have long been inured to ineffective policies and procedures when it comes to eliminating counterfeits.</p>



<p><strong>Listing issues</strong></p>



<p>Whilst far from perfect, Amazon and Facebook, when notified about a counterfeit, will at least respond and take some action – eventually. Google, prior to a recent development, would not.</p>



<p>Google would not agree to do anything when asked to remove a Web site that infringes trademarks from organic search.</p>



<p>Brands traditionally had first to obtain a court order – with all the cost and inconvenience that this entails – before Google would agree to evaluate trademark infringement.</p>



<p>Baidu, by contrast, purports to welcome notifications in relation to trademarks.</p>



<p>This has long been a major issue for luxury brands. The nature of luxury goods is such that they are faked and brought to market unlawfully on a scale unlike almost any other.</p>



<p>Bad actors have long ditched traditional bricks-and-mortar shopfronts in favor of the freedoms and relative impunity made possible by the digital world where they can enjoy instant access to a near-limitless, global market, fueled by the tremendous power of search engines.</p>



<p>The rigidity of Google’s position in this area has made it all but impossible for luxury brands to secure appropriate and effective relief.</p>



<p>The scale of the issue for luxury brands is so colossal that it is simply not realistic to expect that brands will seek to obtain court orders each time they want to request that a Web site be de-indexed from organic search. This means that luxury brands have typically had to prioritize one search related threat over another, whilst never tackling the problem at source.</p>



<p>Stakeholders have long campaigned for change in this area. Incopro, for example, released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/how-and-why-search-engines-must-take-responsibility-for-tackling-counterfeiters/">research study</a>&nbsp;in October 2019 that found that, depending on the sector, up to six in 10 Google search results led online shoppers to Web sites offering for sale fake goods.</p>



<p><strong>Soul searching?</strong></p>



<p>In June, Google&nbsp;<a href="https://searchengineland.com/a-look-at-googles-recent-covid-19-related-policies-in-search-330992">implemented changes to its policy</a>, leveling up trademarks with copyright. Google has allowed users to issue DMCA-style copyright notifications for some time.</p>



<p>The timing of the change is striking. In an apparent&nbsp;<em>volte face</em>, Google now no longer requires brands to secure a court order and is prepared to remove from organic search results individual URLs which are notified to it, which infringe trademarks and which link to Web sites selling counterfeits.</p>



<p>Whilst many correctly acknowledge this as a positive step forward, it is clear that much more can and should be done.</p>



<p>Google continues to do nothing about Web sites, comprising potentially tens of thousands of individual URLs, even where those sites are dedicated to infringing trademarks and serve no legitimate purpose.</p>



<p>Many Web sites will “self declare” themselves to be infringing through, for example, using the word “fake” adjacent to a brand incorporated within the domain name used to operate the site.</p>



<p>Still, Google will do nothing. The result is that brands are left in the unsatisfactory position of having to notify Google of each individual URL – a daunting task occupying precious resources, which could plainly be better directed elsewhere.</p>



<p>Through its inaction, Google continues to place a significant burden on rights holders seeking to protect their brands and their consumers.</p>



<p>LUXURY BRANDS can and should continue to lobby for further change.</p>



<p>As the legislative and regulatory framework in this area constricts platforms ever tighter, the opportunity for luxury brands to drive meaningful and lasting change in platform behavior widens.</p>



<p>Exerting maximum, collective pressure in this area gives the best chance of making the Internet better for businesses and their consumers.</p>
