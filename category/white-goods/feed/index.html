										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Counterfeiters and other online bad actors are opportunistic at their core and will seize on any chance to make a quick profit out of unsuspecting consumers. The COVID-19 crisis is no different, with bad actors swift to list both medical products and everyday consumer items at marked-up prices as demand skyrockets.</strong></p>



<p>Price gouging refers to the act of exploiting consumers during an external crisis by charging excessive prices for products far above the market rate. During the COVID-19 crisis, price gouging has been observed on B2C marketplaces and websites by distributors and private sellers. Many countries have anti-price gouging legislation to protect consumers during national emergencies, but even where protections do not exist platforms will often prohibit the practice.</p>



<p>In April, Amazon claimed it had removed more than half a million COVID-related items and suspended more than 6,000 sellers across its global marketplaces after infringing its price gouging rules[1].</p>



<p>In an unusual step, Amazon has even gone as far as requesting new legislation to be drafted with VP of Public Policy Brian Huseman calling on Congress to make price gouging illegal during a national crisis[2]. The executive notes that similar laws already exist at state level and are effective at fighting bad actors online.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 crisis has seen a dramatic increase in price gouging on a wide range of products, including those that consumers are more reliant on than ever: pharmaceuticals, hygiene products, and medical equipment. This piece looks at the data, providing analysis of the scale of the issue, before sharing insights into how your business can tackle this growing threat effectively.</p>



<h3>Price gouging pharmaceuticals: Exploiting vulnerable consumers</h3>



<p>COVID-19 related price gouging was first identified on marketplace listings for pharmaceuticals and other medical equipment supplies. Globally, enforcement agencies and regional authorities are looking to demonstrate their vigilance to the public in this climate and are watching for price hikes.</p>

<p>Talisman, Incopro’s Brand Protection platform, has identified rampant price gouging in recent weeks &#8211; which were then acted on by our analysts. These are just two of the countless infringing listings discovered:</p>



<ul><li>Price gouging of up to a staggering <strong>750%</strong> for a well-known painkiller with a box of 24 capsules on eBay for <strong>$329</strong> with no guarantee they are authentic.</li><li>Price gouging of up to <strong>100%</strong> for a global cold &amp; flu brand across key marketplaces around the world.</li></ul>



<p>Price gougers are exploiting vulnerable consumers who feel that they have little choice but to pay the hugely inflated prices for essential medical drugs and supplies.</p>



<h3><strong>Price gouging on consumer goods: Taking advantage of spikes in demand</strong></h3>



<p>The issue is not isolated to the health sector; we have also observed an increase in price gouging across a wide range of other product categories. Incopro’s Brand Protection experts harnessed Talisman to monitor these product categories on Amazon US for price gouging:</p>



<h4>Desks and computer monitors</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>desks</strong> and <strong>computer monitors</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings on average by <strong>193%</strong> since COIVD-19 hit. An example can be seen below, showing the increase in price listed by a third-party seller for a desk from the beginning of the year to now, clearly taking advantage of the crisis.</p>



<p>One listing for a simple home-working desk saw a large price increase of <strong>247%</strong>, going from <strong>$89</strong> to <strong>$220</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1000" height="476" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020.jpg" alt="Price fluctuations on home office furniture sold on Amazon.com (May 2020)" class="wp-image-8072" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020.jpg 1000w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption>Price fluctuations on home office furniture sold on Amazon.com (May 2020)</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Sports and exercise equipment</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>bench presses</strong> and <strong>yoga mats</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings by <strong>168%</strong> on average since COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>One listing saw a large price increase of <strong>370%</strong>, going from <strong>$160</strong> to <strong>$330</strong>. This screenshot of a customer review from March 2020 shows that the product listed was cheap and potentially harmful, yet concedes that there’s ‘slim pickings’ due to the pandemic’s effect on supply:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1378" height="345" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020.png" alt="Amazon customer review for bench press (March 2020)" class="wp-image-8074" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020.png 1378w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-300x75.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-1024x256.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-768x192.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1378px) 100vw, 1378px" /><figcaption>Amazon customer review for bench press (March 2020)</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Home entertainment</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>a leading games console</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings by <strong>161%</strong> since COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>This data shows that sellers are taking advantage of COVID-19 to increase the prices of their listings, with all categories showing sellers increasing their prices by over <strong>150%</strong> since the crisis has hit.</p>



<h3>The threat to consumer safety and brand reputation</h3>



<p>Not only do consumers face the prospect of massively overpaying for a product, there is also a chance that the products they are purchasing are already used[3] – meaning consumers are not getting what they paid for, or even non-genuine – putting consumers at risk of physical harm.</p>



<p>Brands face a two-fold issue with price gouging:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Policing distributors that are selling genuine product far above the market rate/agreed price</li><li>Removing copycat/counterfeit products that use the brand’s IP and are sold far above the market rate</li></ol>



<p>Price gouging damages brand reputation and consumer trust in a brand, regardless if the product on offer is genuine. Distributors of the products will not face the brunt of your reputational damage, even if they are the party engaging in price gouging. Any damage is likely to be long-term and extremely difficult to repair.</p>



<p>In April, Incopro polled 87 business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, asking about what they perceived to be the biggest risk to their businesses due to COVID-19 – over&nbsp;<strong>45%</strong>&nbsp;said the risk to consumer trust and the consumer-to-brand relationship. This highlights that they recognize the risk that the shift in market dynamic has created.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Platforms cannot tackle the threat alone</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve noted that some platforms are taking action, and governments are setting up dedicated &#8216;price gouging&#8217; taskforces &#8211; but they are unable to stem the tide alone. Amazon, for example, will actively monitor for price gouging, but due to the scale of the problem and the limits of their technology may be slow to identity and remove infringements. However, if they are notified by a brand of specific instances of price gouging, they will be able to act far swifter.</p>



<p>Incopro’s Brand Protection technology and expert analysts give you cross-platform, cross-territory insights into price gouging with a tried and tested online enforcement solution delivered at scale directly from the platform. The platform can also collate evidence packs for injunctions and wider monetary relief. and bespoke reporting by brand, platform, territory provides internal stakeholders with valuable sales insights.</p>



<p>Price gouging is not a new phenomenon – it existed before COVID-19 and will continue even as the global crisis eventually subsides. By taking a strong stance now, you can put consumer safety at the heart of your Brand Protection strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Counterfeit white goods can be found easily through search engines, putting consumer health and safety at grave risk.</h2>



<p>Incopro research reveals that websites offering these potentially dangerous counterfeits goods are often found on search engines, and brands currently have no easy means of having these indexed results removed.</p>



<p>Incopro is calling for search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yandex to do more to safeguard consumers from fakes before more stringent regulation is required.</p>



<h3>The dangers of counterfeit white goods</h3>



<p>Counterfeit parts can cause irreparable damage to expensive appliances. Even worse, appliance failure potentially can lead to electrical fires and&nbsp;deadly gas&nbsp;leaks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When making a purchase of white goods, consumers tend to rely on trusted brands and traditional supply chains &#8211; the complexity of these appliances makes it more difficult for infringers to fool consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The costs involved with manufacturing and distributing finished counterfeit appliances also creates a barrier to entry for bad actors.</p>



<p>However, it is replacement parts where the issue lies. Disreputable suppliers seek to fool cost-conscious consumers who search online for cheap replacement parts to extend the life of their white goods.</p>



<p>Fake replacement refrigerator parts such as water filters pose a danger to consumers, who rely on them to filter out contaminants &#8211; counterfeits are not up to this vital&nbsp;task.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Online sales of counterfeit refrigerator water filters are a rapidly growing problem. These counterfeit water filters are sold with misleading and fraudulent labelling, often including illegal use of brand names, logos, and product labels,”</em></p><cite>the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) warns in an online public awareness campaign(1).<br>&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p>The group’s independent tests of counterfeit water filters purchased from websites demonstrate the alarming dangers that consumers face from a mistaken purchase:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“[1] Counterfeit filters failed to remove harmful lead from household water. [2] Counterfeit filters failed to remove live cysts from household water. [3] Some counterfeit filters introduced harmful compounds into household water.”</em></p></blockquote>



<h3>The availability of fake replacement parts through search</h3>



<p>One counterfeit website identified by Incopro was ‘refrigerator-water-filters.com’. The website listed four brands (Whirlpool, Samsung, Kenmore and GE) in its page title to deliberately cause consumer confusion and helped it to appear in search engine results when consumers searched for those brands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All consumers arrived at this website via organic search. The top 5 keywords used to find the website were associated with genuine refrigerator water filter models: 69625-ct-001, aprilaire ffc20256sg, idylis es 12-id, ph21210 whir, and kohler k20852-na.35<sup>[2]</sup><br></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="363" height="214" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6532" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.png 363w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>When conducting a search using these search terms on Google.com, ‘refrigerator-water-filters.com’ appeared on&nbsp;the first page of results in 4 out of 5 searches.</p>



<p>Refrigerator-water-filters.com offered a variety of counterfeit brand name and fake replacement water filters that were likely neither safe nor actually compatible with the refrigerators. For example, it offered a filter that it described as a “Whirlpool EDR1RXD1” and another that was described as a “Maytag Puriclean III” alongside pictures of packaging and product that contained brand name logos. The AHAM research suggests that these water filters did not meet consumer water filtration safety standards, potentially exposing unsuspecting consumers to contaminants.</p>



<p>The ‘About Us’ section of the Refrigerator-water-filters.com website noted that the company was headquartered in China where “production and product development takes place”. From there, the products were shipped worldwide. Even though it claimed to produce and develop its own filters, it also falsely claimed that branded items were “original”.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="425" height="35" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6534" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-1.png 425w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-1-300x25.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left heading-branded bg-grey--light">Search Engines: Time to step up</h2>



<p>Concern about consumer safety should extend beyond brands and industry groups, as fake replacement parts continue to pose a clear and present danger. A concerted, joint effort is needed to protect consumers, with search engines at the forefront.</p>



<p>Brands are often powerless to act alone, as rogue counterfeit-supporting web hosts are uncooperative with website takedown requests.</p>



<p>Incopro calls for search engines such as Google to work with brands to establish a swift process to have counterfeit sites removed from results.</p>
