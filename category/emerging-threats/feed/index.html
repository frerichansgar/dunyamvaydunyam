<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2021 posed unique challenges to brand protection teams, with online threats increasingly varied, supply chains disrupted, and department budgets tightening.</strong></p>



<p>Throughout this year however, members of the global brand protection community INSYNC remained resolute in their goal to protect consumers, with teams continually adapting to the fast-evolving online environment. Quotes and insights from the INSYNC community show teams responding to prolonged global uncertainty and shifts in online behavior by refocusing strategy, collaborating with internal teams, and building relationships with e-commerce platforms.</p>



<p>Read this blog to learn about the key developments within the industry in 2021, including emerging threats, new legislation, and innovative approaches to brand protection strategy.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Emerging threats in 2021</h2>



<p>The pandemic has continued to disrupt supply chains across the globe, meaning consumers have had difficulty in obtaining certain branded products. Counterfeiters and other bad actors have seized this opportunity to impersonate brands and defraud consumers.</p>



<h3 id="h-social-media-phishing-and-scams">Social media phishing and scams</h3>



<p>Brands in 2021 faced a growing tide of phishing scams and other types of fraud targeting their customers on social media.</p>



<p>Social media cybercrime generates a staggering&nbsp;<strong>$3.25</strong> billion&nbsp;for criminal networks annually[1]. <strong>61%</strong> of companies&nbsp;experience phishing attacks via their social media channels[2]. And as social media usage continues to increase, scammers have sought new methods to exploit brands and consumers.</p>



<p>Facebook and Instagram have emerged as popular platforms for fake ‘brand giveaways’, where scammers impersonate well-known brands advertising offering free product giveaways. Once consumers submit their personal information, the scammers use this to conduct identity and financial fraud.</p>



<p>In a sign of growing frustration from authorities, the&nbsp;head of enforcement at the FCA (UK) stated:</p>



<p><em>“Social media sites are effectively a gateway in which scammers are getting access to vast numbers of people in the population through online searches.”[3]</em></p>



<p>While platforms are taking steps to combat scammers, it is clear they can go further. Businesses too must adapt their brand protection strategies to safeguard consumers’ digital safety and trust on social media as threats continue to grow.</p>

<h3>COVID-related scams</h3>



<p>Brands and consumers contended with a barrage of COVID-related scams and fake products during 2021. These threats included:</p>



<h4>Listings for COVID vaccines on B2B &amp; B2C marketplaces</h4>



<p>Incopro’s experts have detected several unauthorized listings claiming to be ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Direct Suppliers’ on B2B platforms EC21, Ecplaza, and Tradekey. With the listings not directly referring to branded vaccines, identifying the key platforms sellers use to advertise these fake or unauthorized products plays a significant role in proactive enforcement.</p>



<p>COVID vaccine listings can often also be found on B2C platforms such as eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist. These usually involve sellers offering slots to get the vaccine. COVID vaccine manufacturers have confirmed to Incopro that the majority of these online offers are scams.</p>



<h4>Criminals selling COVID-related products</h4>



<p>Fake vaccine passports / certificates and even COVID test results are being sold on e-commerce websites and, increasingly, the dark web[4].</p>



<p>Law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) in the US are pursuing false COVID-related products and are notifying registrars when their services are used by bad actors. However, with over 1,000 COVID-related domains being registered per day, it’s clear that registrars and web hosts need to do more.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Legislation targeting platforms – EU</h2>



<p>On the legislative front 2021 heralded many promising changes, with increased pressure placed on e-commerce platforms and other online intermediaries.</p>



<p>In December 2020, The European Commission published its much-anticipated&nbsp;Digital Services Act package of measures<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;in what may amount potentially to the most sweeping reforms to tech regulation in Europe for more than two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two separate pieces of legislation (the&nbsp;Digital Services Act&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Digital Markets Act) appear to signify the arrival of root and branch reform to the Internet platform economy, assuming the draft texts are adopted by the European Parliament and are enacted into law.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The Digital Services Act (DSA)</h3>



<p>The DSA is designed to regulate the way in which platforms handle illegal or harmful content in their capacity as intermediaries which connect consumers with goods, services and content.</p>



<p>A central theme to the DSA is the notion that technology companies will need now to take much more responsibility for unlawful behavior on their platforms – and will face serious financial penalties if they do not.</p>



<p>While brand owners welcome the proposed legislation, there are several key improvements that are needed. Perhaps most critical of these are:</p>



<ul><li>Trusted Flaggers – ‘Trusted Flagger’ rules should apply to all hosting services and trusted flagger status should be available to all entities which demonstrate expertise and a high rate of accuracy when flagging content regardless of whether or not they are part of trade associations or collective bodies.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Repeat Infringers – The scope of this provision is too narrow; it needs to apply to all hosting services (e.g. cyberlockers). It should also permit the termination of the provision of services in egregious cases – for example in cases of repeated suspension.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/the-digital-services-act-what-do-brand-and-content-owners-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about DSA changes requested by brand owners &gt;</a></p>



<h3>The Digital Markets Act (DMA)</h3>



<p>In contrast to the DSA,&nbsp;the DMA&nbsp;applies to large online platforms which act as “Gatekeepers” in digital markets – acting as critical gateways for business users to reach end users (consumers). This includes search engines, intermediation services, social networking services, video-sharing platforms, operating systems, interpersonal communication services, cloud computing and advertising[6].</p>



<p>The DMA seeks to regulate these platforms to ensure that the markets in which they operate remain fair and competitive. The DMA imposes restrictions and obligations to ensure that Gatekeeper platforms behave in a fair way online.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/the-digital-services-act-unwrapped-initial-implications-for-platforms-brands-and-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about EU legislative developments ></a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Legislation targeting platforms – US</h2>



<p>Similar trends were observed in the US, with legislators increasing looking at the role of platforms and online intermediaries in facilitating the sale or access of infringing products and services.</p>



<h3>The Shop Safe Act</h3>



<p>The US Shop Safe Act Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 (The Lanham Act), with the addition of a section to make e-commerce platforms liable for trademark infringement and counterfeiting if they do not follow a number of best practices such as screening sellers and enforcing against repeat infringers.</p>



<h3>The INFORM Consumers Act</h3>



<p>The US INFORM Consumers Act (The Integrity, Notification, and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers), requires online marketplaces to collect, verify and disclose certain information from high-volume third-party sellers.</p>



<p>Following discussions in the senate, e-commerce platforms lobbied to define high-volume third-party sellers to include those that conduct 200 or more transactions resulting in total revenues of $7,000 or more during a continuous 12-month period.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/shop-safe-inform-consumers-act-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about US legislative developments &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Increased focus on repeat infringers</h2>



<p>In early 2021 Incopro released ‘Three Strikes and Out’, a white paper that explores how e-commerce platforms can tackle repeat infringers – an issue that brand owners are increasingly highlighting.</p>



<p>We found that <strong>23</strong> of the <strong>34</strong> e-commerce platforms considered have a policy directed at repeat infringers. The remaining <strong>11</strong> had no relevant policy evident. Out of the <strong>23</strong> e-commerce platforms that have a policy, only 3 had enacted a three-strikes rule.</p>



<p>We noted that platforms that do have a clear ‘three strikes’ rule and robust seller verification process – such as Aliexpress – see fewer repeat infringements than other platforms.</p>



<p>The white paper analyzed over 1.5m enforcements to help understand the scale of the issue, before setting out how brands, platforms and legislators can address the challenge to protect consumers, reduce losses suffered to counterfeiting and support rights holders.</p>



<p>Incopro’s analysis shows that:</p>



<ul><li>Only&nbsp;<strong>6%</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;sellers&nbsp;are&nbsp;repeatedly enforced on <strong>3 days</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>more</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>However, these sellers are responsible for over&nbsp;<strong>24%</strong>&nbsp;of the listings Incopro has enforced against&nbsp;</li><li>The models show that&nbsp;a seller verification and repeat infringer policy would significantly benefit consumers, brands, legislators, and the platforms themselves</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/three-strikes-and-out-how-e-commerce-platforms-can-protect-consumers-from-repeat-offenders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read the full findings and policy recommendations &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Recognition of outcomes, not takedowns</h2>



<p><strong>“It’s important we’re not seen as ‘whack-a-mole’. It’s only whack-a-mole if you don’t apply data.”</strong></p>



<p><em>Gary Wengrofsky, Senior Director, Intellectual Property, Charter Communications speaking at the INSYNC Virtual Summit: November 2021</em></p>



<p>In 2021, the shift towards outcomes picked up pace. Many brand protection teams now set KPIs that focus on reducing the volume of infringement and cleaning up priority platforms, rather than the number of takedown notices sent.</p>



<p>With this approach, teams can free up resources for both targeted enforcement against high-risk infringements and to conduct in-depth data analysis and other value-adding activities. They can then deliver commercial value to the business and vastly increase return on investment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/brand-protection-kpis-how-to-focus-on-outcomes-not-takedowns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn how shifting the focus to outcomes delivers greater long-term value &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">A new brand protection maturity model</h2>



<p>With threats growing in both scale and variety, brand protection teams had a huge amount of ground to cover in 2021. From counterfeit goods and copycats, to fake NFTs and social media phishing scams, there are countless ways a company&#8217;s identity can be infringed and damaged online. The threats each business and industry faces vary, but there are general steps all organizations can take to evolve their approach.</p>



<p>As they mature, teams become an increasingly strategic asset — able not only to counter threats, but to identify new growth opportunities for the business.</p>



<p>In 2021, Incopro released an Online Brand Protection Maturity Report that outlines the four stages of this journey. From reactive teams that find themselves firefighting infringements, to effective teams that make use of advanced technology to tackle issues at scale, to progressive teams that champion wider applications of brand protection within their organizations.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>With e-commerce spending during Black Friday and Singles’ Day growing each year, brand protection teams need to be aware of the latest emerging threats and infringement trends. Read this blog to learn how you can protect your brand and consumers online during the holiday season.</strong></p>



<p>Counterfeiting, phishing, impersonation, and hashtag hijacking are just a handful of the online threats that brands face during the holiday season. And with an environment of fast-moving flash sales and large-scale discounting, it can be difficult to keep up with infringers.</p>



<p><strong>Read this blog to learn</strong>:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#consumer-behavior">The shifts in online consumer behavior</a></li><li><a href="#trends">The holiday infringement trends, including counterfeiting, phishing, and review fraud</a></li><li><a href="#solutions">How brands can protect consumers and key revenue streams</a></li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="consumer-behavior">The shifts in online consumer behavior</h2>



<p>In 2020, the US e-commerce market grew by over 30%, shooting past previous projections[1]. In the same year, US holiday spending reached $100 billion by December[2].&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2021 e-commerce growth has continued at lightning pace. In the US, e-commerce grew by 39.1% in Q1 2021. Comparatively, e-commerce grew by 13.8% in Q1 2020[3]. In Q2 2021, nearly $1 of every $5 spent on retail purchases in the US was online[4].</p>



<p>In the EU, total e-commerce revenues hit US$425.2bn in 2020, an increase of US$71bn from 2019[5]. And in 2021, the market is forecasted to grow by another 9.5%[6]. Brick-and-mortar footfall has shown signs of strong recovery from the pandemic, but its growth rate still lags behind e-commerce at 4.8%[7].</p>



<p>Online buying behavior often differs during the holiday season with consumers snapping up time-limited deals on third party e-commerce sites or marketplaces, instead of seeking out specific brands’ websites.</p>



<p>In China, the annual Singles’ Day e-commerce shopping festival has fueled an explosion in livestream sales. On just the first day of the Alibaba Singles’ Day pre-sales event, Li Jiaqi, a top livestream salesman sold a staggering US$1.9 billion in products and attained nearly 250 million video views[8]. </p>



<p>Deal aggregate websites often see a spike in traffic during the holiday season. These websites redirect to countless external sites, some of which are unfamiliar to the consumer and likely to have been set up only a few days prior. It is difficult for consumers to ascertain the legitimacy of these external sites, and they are at risk of inadvertently visiting scam sites</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="trends">Holiday season infringement trends</h2>



<p>COVID-19 caused widespread disruption to supply chains across the globe, impacting businesses’ ability to fulfill consumer demand. Infringers capitalized on this throughout the pandemic, with cases of falsified and substandard medical products were sold to consumers and, in some cases, even hospitals[9].</p>



<p>In 2021, similar activity has been observed in the run up to the holiday season, where supply from legitimate businesses is unable to meet demand and bad actors are seizing the opportunity to infiltrate marketplaces.</p>



<p>Delays at UK ports will result in toy shortages this Christmas, according to Gary Grant, CEO at UK toy retailer The Entertainer[10]. Infringers are likely to jump at this opportunity to plug the supply gap with fake goods.</p>



<h3>Counterfeits and other infringing listings</h3>



<p>The holiday season is a hotbed for brand infringement. And with the pandemic fueling record e-commerce demand in 2020, infringers were keen to promote their counterfeits and other infringing products to as many consumers as possible.</p>



<p>For example, in the week of Thanksgiving (the run up to Black Friday), compared to a week 3 months back, Incopro’s technology detected the following increases in counterfeit and other infringing listings on popular marketplaces:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="535" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-1024x535.png" alt="Holiday Season Brand Protection Counterfeit Listings" class="wp-image-17767" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-1024x535.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-300x157.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-768x401.png 768w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Percentage growth of infringement on Amazon &amp; eBay in the run up to the 2020 holiday season (Incopro data from 2020)</em> [11]</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Phishing scams and impersonation</h3>



<p>During the holiday season, social media platforms are inundated with both legitimate and illegitimate accounts promoting time-limited deals. Consumers may find it difficult to distinguish between the real and the fake, falling prey to impersonation accounts that redirect them to websites operating phishing schemes.</p>



<p>‘Thematic’ phishing scams pose a significant threat to brands and consumers during e-commerce festivals periods such as Black Friday and Singles’ Day. In one case, Facebook accounts masquerading as&nbsp;an FMCG brand&#8217;s official Facebook account were promoting fake giveaways and competitions in order to&nbsp;obtain consumers’ personal data.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="535" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-1024x535.png" alt="Holiday Season Brand Protection Phishing Scams" class="wp-image-17776" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-1024x535.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-300x157.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-768x401.png 768w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Between October and December 2020, one FMCG brand saw &#8216;competition&#8217; phishing scams&nbsp;grow by 14.5x (1350%) on Facebook (Incopro data from 2020)</em> [12]</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>After the holiday season, the number of anonymized consumer complaints&nbsp;for phishing scams&nbsp;received by the brand reduced swiftly – in January 2021 consumer complaints had dropped by almost 50%&nbsp;compared to December 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Incopro’s analysts detected a large increase in phishing scams targeting a household appliances brand in the run up to Black Friday 2020, compared to 2019. After Black Friday, these websites quickly switched their focus to Christmas themed scams. New Year’s themed websites emerged then soon after.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/brand-protection-social-media-tackling-scams-impersonation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about tackling social media scams and impersonation &gt;</a></p>



<h3>Digital ads and hashtag hijacking</h3>



<p>Infringers effectively operate as a primary competitor, undercutting price and hijacking hard-earned brand equity. Without a dedicated strategy to tackle infringers during the holiday season, brands often find themselves with inflated digital spend as they vie for the same advertising space.</p>



<p>Social media advertising and hashtag hijacking are tactics used by bad actors to promote counterfeit and other infringing products during the holiday season. Incopro’s brand protection experts note the increasing use of ‘#blackfriday’ and ‘#promoblackfriday’ in Instagram posts to promote counterfeit products such as watches during the four-week run-up to Black Friday[13].</p>



<p>Bad actors also commonly use holiday-themed hashtags to promote phishing scams to unsuspecting consumers. These scam posts sit alongside posts from genuine accounts within ‘trending categories’ on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, making it difficult for consumers to spot the danger.</p>



<h3>Fake reviews</h3>



<p>97% of shoppers rely on online customer reviews to help make a purchase[14]. In the UK, online reviews influence up to £23 billion of annual consumer spending[15].</p>



<p>Bad actors use fake reviews as a tactic to lend an air of legitimacy to infringing products. Fake reviews pose an issue on global e-commerce and social media platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and Facebook – and even on dedicated review websites such as TripAdvisor.</p>



<p>Sellers manipulate star-rating systems and post positive reviews to push consumers towards purchases. Other popular practices include promising free gifts, vouchers or discounts to customers that leave positive or five-star reviews – this is often against of platforms’ seller policies.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded" id="solutions">Adapt your brand protection strategy for the holiday season</h2>



<h3>Build strong platform relationships</h3>



<p>Platform collaboration should sit as a core tenet of your brand protection strategy. Consider which marketplace or social media platform your customers visit most often and the sellers they purchase your products from. With this data, you can begin to prioritize and develop robust relationships with the platforms that hold the greatest commercial significance.</p>



<p>You should then seek to engage with them directly or through a trusted partner to educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform’s own reputation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/why-platform-relationships-are-critical-to-brand-protection-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about building platform relationships &gt;</a></p>



<h3>Collaborate with marketing and e-commerce functions</h3>



<p>Businesses that are unable to spot trends and threats in advance of the holiday season are unlikely to be able to tackle bad actors at scale; they will be reactive, rather than proactive in their enforcement efforts. They may quickly find themselves racing to the bottom in an attempt to keep up with infringers’ discounting and internal sales targets. Collaboration with your marketing and e-commerce teams is therefore essential to protecting price, profit margins, and brand equity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Through collaboration, you can build an understanding of the platforms that will receive the highest volume of traffic through the holiday season. You can also build a plan of action to protect popular product lines, any new product launches, and promotions during the period.</p>



<p>Additionally, you may be able to identify potential online opportunities for your business such as gaps in your product portfolio, untapped demand in new markets, and emerging e-commerce platforms.</p>

<h3>Harness advanced brand protection technology</h3>



<p>Technology plays a critical role in supporting an effective, year-round online brand protection program. Your team will need to be able to operate at scale, with greater visibility of risks and the ability to automatically detect threats across all channels, extract key data, prioritize targets, and enforce – all at scale.</p>



<p>Incopro Brand Protection Consultant <strong>Tosshan Ramgolam</strong> states: <em>“Listings taking part in e-commerce festivals such as Singles’ Day often feature banner images next to the price. </em>You’ll need brand protection technology that can<strong>&nbsp;</strong>either collect this information from the page source or<strong>&nbsp;</strong>deploys optical character recognition in order to extract the text embedded in these banners.<em> You can then use this data as an indicator for risk to monitor counterfeiting activity for brands.”</em></p>

<h4>Advanced brand protection technology: network analysis</h4>



<p>Your team will also need a solution to find, prioritize, and act against infringer networks that operate across multiple channels. With real time data, you can take down entire networks instead of individual accounts and can significantly impact infringers’ abilities to scale-up promotion in advance of the holiday season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Marketplaces, e-commerce websites and social media platforms are flooded by both fake versions of licensed goods and counterfeit cosmetics in the run up to seasonal events such as Halloween, at the expense of consumer safety and brand reputation.</strong></p>



<p>This Halloween, with festivities predicted to return with a bang and e-commerce spending projected to reach $2.94 billion[1] in the US, businesses are preparing to tackle a record volume of infringement.</p>



<p>It is critical brand protection teams work with platforms and utilize technology to take the fight to infringers and protect both consumers and licensees from ghastly threats.</p>



<p><strong>Read this piece to learn:</strong></p>



<ul><li>How infringers promote products during seasonal events</li><li>Fake costumes trends during Halloween</li><li>Fake cosmetics trends during Halloween</li><li>The brand protection solutions to tackle threats all year round</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-counterfeiters-prey-on-seasonal-sales-and-holidays">COUNTERFEITERS PREY ON SEASONAL SALES AND HOLIDAYS</h2>



<p>In 2020, 52% of US parents sourced Halloween costumes in physical stores[2]. However, this year 55% of parents plan to find costumes online[3], suggesting a continued shift in shopping habits – and a greater risk that consumers end up with fake products.</p>



<p>Bad actors use targeted advertising on social media and promoted listings on marketplaces to offer counterfeit and unlicensed goods to unsuspecting consumers. Adverts offer infringing products a level of credibility, fooling many consumers into thinking they are purchasing goods from official channels.</p>



<p>Infringing listings and scam websites often disappear without a trace after the seasonal demand drops-off, leaving consumers out of pocket and unable to replace their low-quality product in time for the festivities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left has-small-font-size"><em>Spikes in infringing listings for costumes based on characters from popular children’s brands (Incopro, 2021)</em></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-fake-licensed-goods-haunting-marketplaces">FAKE LICENSED GOODS HAUNTING MARKETPLACES</h2>



<p>Each year, online marketplaces are inundated with listings for costumes and props in the run up to Halloween. Some of these are genuine – unfortunately many are not. Often these costumes are based on popular films, TV shows, video games, and comics. Licensees are left helpless as their listings are pushed further and further down marketplace search rankings, with unlicensed merchandise and counterfeits taking their place.</p>



<p>Counterfeit or otherwise unlicensed costumes also put consumers at risk. They are often made with low-quality materials and may easily tear. In October 2021, an online store ‘Mr Gadget Solutions’ based in the UK was recently fined for selling counterfeit children’s costumes that could have posed a fire risk[4]. The costumes – for popular superheroes such as Batman – were sold on eBay for less than £5.</p>



<p>Brands must act. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incopro research</a> finds that consumers who end up with counterfeits will direct the majority of their criticism at the brand rather than the platform – <strong>52%</strong> of consumers who unintentionally purchase fakes will lose trust in a brand[5].</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-examples-of-spooky-fake-costumes-in-2021">Examples of spooky fake costumes in 2021</h2>



<p>Our brand protection analysts have identified a number of counterfeit and unlicensed costumes heading into Halloween 2021. Popular South-Korean drama Squid Game recently took the streaming world by storm, and a quick scan of eBay and Amazon reveals dozens of high-risk listings.</p>



<p>With Netflix seemingly caught by surprise at the popularity of the show, there is little official merchandise available. Opportunistic infringers have instead filled the gap with unlicensed merchandise, using lifted still images from the hit series and trademarks in their listings.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>Example of suspicious listings found on Etsy using the search term ‘Tiger King’ (18th October 2021)</em></p>



<p>Other popular targets include characters such as Lola Bunny from the recent Space Jam sequel and Monkey D. Luffy from the popular anime and manga series One Piece.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full clear-bottom"><img width="1194" height="178" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lola-Bunny-Monkey-D.-Luffy-costume-listings_2021.png" alt="Brand Protection Halloween Fake Costumes eBay" class="wp-image-17693" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lola-Bunny-Monkey-D.-Luffy-costume-listings_2021.png 1194w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lola-Bunny-Monkey-D.-Luffy-costume-listings_2021-300x45.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lola-Bunny-Monkey-D.-Luffy-costume-listings_2021-1024x153.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lola-Bunny-Monkey-D.-Luffy-costume-listings_2021-768x114.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1194px) 100vw, 1194px" /></figure>



<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>Examples of suspicious listings found on eBay using the search term ‘Loba bunny costume’ and ‘Luffy ‘Monkey D. Luffy costume’ respectively (18th October 2021)</em></p>



<p>Superheroes and villains are prized targets at Halloween. With the recent release of The Suicide Squad in cinemas, infringers have listed costumes and temporary tattoos designed to emulate the look of fan-favorite Harley Quinn. Again, this listing uses lifts imagery from the film’s marketing materials such as posters and promotional stills.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-trick-not-treat-counterfeit-halloween-cosmetics-put-consumers-at-risk">Trick, Not Treat: Counterfeit Halloween cosmetics put consumers at risk</h2>



<p>Cosmetics are also a popular target for bad actors. $69 million worth of fake cosmetic and pharmaceutical products were seized in the US in 2017, making up 6.5% of all counterfeit seizures.</p>



<p>Multi-colored lenses are often used as a finishing touch to Halloween costumes. Fake contact lenses are widely available, with PIPCU and the US government warning against their purchase.</p>



<p>Counterfeit contact lenses can be particularly dangerous, either through incorrect usage (contact lenses are usually prescribed) or due to the materials used. Opticians warn that their use can lead to infections, conjunctivitis, and impaired vision[6]. Seized counterfeit contact lenses have even been found to contain toxic materials such as lead[7].</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-brand-protection-solutions-to-tackle-threats-all-year-round">Brand protection solutions to tackle threats all year round</h2>



<p>Platform collaboration should sit as a core tenet of your brand protection strategy. Consider which marketplace or social media platform your customers visit most often and the sellers they purchase your products from. You&#8217;ll also need to be cognisant of the platforms used by your licensees to sell their goods. With this data, you can begin to prioritize and develop robust relationships with the platforms that hold the greatest commercial significance.</p>



<p>You should then seek to engage with them directly or through a trusted partner. The following checklist is useful to kick off your relationship building exercise:</p>



<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts within the platforms’ support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;</li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;</li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;and interact with the relevant representatives where the platform has local websites</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-advanced-online-brand-protection-technology-critical-to-success">Advanced online brand protection technology critical to success</h3>



<p>It is critical to deploy <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/online-brand-protection/talisman-brand-protection-software/">online brand protection technology</a> that works in tandem with platform tools to tackle infringements such as counterfeit or unlicensed costumers at scale, but also:</p>



<ul><li>Collects more data on the individuals exploiting your brand</li><li>Prioritizes high-risk listings that your consumers are most likely to find</li><li>Makes the connection between brand exploiters operating across multiple channels and regions</li></ul>



<p>The following are some of the key indicators used to identify and prioritize infringements:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Price</strong>&nbsp;– fake costumes are listed for prices as low as £3.99 to undercut genuine listings</li><li><strong>Typos or grammatical mistakes within the listing</strong> –&nbsp;spelling mistakes of the product or brand name are intentional to deceive consumers</li><li><strong>Seller address and item location</strong> –&nbsp;the listing may claim to be domestic stock but is actually shipped from overseas (or if the seller’s business address is registered overseas)</li><li><strong>Text embedded within listing images</strong> – infringers may embed information such as price, contact details, and product description to avoid keyword detection. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/online-brand-protection/automation-image-technology/">Optical character recognition technology</a> will extract this information.</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-talisman-online-brand-protection-technology-that-delivers-outcomes">TALISMAN: ONLINE BRAND PROTECTION TECHNOLOGY THAT DELIVERS OUTCOMES</h2>



<p>Talisman is more than technology — it’s the smarter way to protect your brand and see long-term impact. Businesses that switch to Talisman see greater reduction of infringements, quicker return on investment, and superior long-term business impacts. They understand their threats better, act quicker and make lasting change.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The NFT market poses an opportunity for brands, but also hidden risks, with counterfeiters and scammers targeting platforms and rights owners. Find out the key threats and how brand protection teams can mitigate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The market for NFTs&nbsp;has&nbsp;exploded recently, with more than $2bn spent in the first quarter of 2021.&nbsp;Global brands are&nbsp;capitalizing&nbsp;on this&nbsp;fertile new ground&nbsp;—&nbsp;the&nbsp;NBA&nbsp;is one organization&nbsp;to have taken advantage of the market so far, creating video clips for fans to collect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As with&nbsp;most&nbsp;emerging&nbsp;opportunities,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;associated threats&nbsp;that brand protection teams&nbsp;should be aware of. The NFT market is no different,&nbsp;as&nbsp;counterfeiters and scammers&nbsp;target&nbsp;nascent&nbsp;platforms and regulations&nbsp;that are some way off&nbsp;being able to fully protect&nbsp;brands and rights owners.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Read this blog to learn:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>What exactly are NFTs&nbsp;and&nbsp;how are they created, stored, and&nbsp;traded?&nbsp;</li><li>How&nbsp;copyright and ownership&nbsp;laws&nbsp;work&nbsp;with NFTs&nbsp;</li><li>How&nbsp;infringers are targeting consumers with fakes, scams,&nbsp;and&nbsp;other&nbsp;tactics&nbsp;</li><li>How&nbsp;brand protection teams can mitigate threats&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-what-is-an-nft">What is an NFT?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>An NFT (non-fungible token) is a unique token created in relation to a specific digital asset, like an image, music track or video clip. People commonly, and mistakenly, think of the asset as the NFT. However,&nbsp;it is the token that is the NFT.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-what-are-nfts-used-for">What are NFTs used for?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>NFTs are well suited to digital collectibles, such as video clips, music tracks,&nbsp;or&nbsp;in-game items. The accuracy and traceability of ownership is the key attraction&nbsp;here.&nbsp;They&nbsp;are also being tried out for unique physical items, but&nbsp;how&nbsp;applicable they are to real world items&nbsp;remains&nbsp;to be seen.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-are-nfts-linked-to-blockchain">How are NFTs linked to blockchain?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The NFT is stored on a blockchain. There are different blockchains, but the most popular for NFTs is&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>. Once on the blockchain, the NFT can be validated, and changes of ownership updated and tracked. This is how the value is passed from owner to owner and anyone can trace the provenance of an asset with certainty.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-do-you-create-an-nft">How do you create an NFT?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>To create an NFT, the creator goes through a process called minting. This process requires the creator to have a wallet with crypto currency in it (e.g.&nbsp;Ethereum), so that the newly created NFT can be linked to the wallet. This establishes the wallet owner as both the original creator and the first owner of the NFT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crypto currency is used to pay the gas fee necessary for minting. This fee is required to successfully complete the transaction on the blockchain and goes to the miners who provide the computing power (gas)&nbsp;behind the network.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-are-nft-s-stored">How are NFT’s stored?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The digital asset is stored either on-chain or off-chain. Some NFTs encode the content in the blockchain data (on-chain) or describe an algorithm for generating an image from the transaction hash. However, the most common storage is off-chain. This means that the NFT resides on the blockchain but the asset itself must be hosted on a server elsewhere with a link to it in the NFT.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-are-nfts-purchased">How are NFTs purchased?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The creation, sale, and trade of NFTs take place on platforms like&nbsp;<a href="https://rarible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rarible</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://opensea.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSea</a>. Users of those platforms can mint their own NFTs, buy, sell and trade them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-brand-protection-considerations-for-nfts">Brand Protection Considerations for NFTs&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-nft-copyright-ownership">NFT copyright&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;ownership&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Upon creation, copyright will subsist as it does ordinarily, dependent on jurisdiction. When the NFT is minted, the copyright owner does not necessarily give away the copyright with the NFT. The two exist separately unless they include assignment of copyright with the NFT. This means that the owner of the copyright can be recognised from the blockchain record and credited with any royalties that may come from exploitation of the work later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NFT and the asset are often separate things, as off-chain storage is the most common method for storing NFTs. This means that the copyright work may still be accessible to the public and able to be copied easily, infringing copyright when the copy is made. This is an important consideration for NFT creators as the creation does not automatically protect the work in any way.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-what-are-counterfeit-nfts">What are counterfeit NFTs?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If a brand mints its own NFTs then it is likely that others will look to issue further identical NFTs in order to confuse consumers. Given that this is likely to happen most in the collectibles space, it will be important to consider how consumers can gain confidence that they are buying the real thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider&nbsp;including an embedded watermark/fingerprint and a verification technology for consumers to check. This is a typical consideration for any content creator. Alternatively, issuing information about the number of NFTs that have been officially minted and sold could give consumers information to recognise flooding of the market for limited edition NFTs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-infringing-nfts-which-include-copyright-work">Infringing&nbsp;NFTs&nbsp;which include copyright work&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A brand may not&nbsp;produce&nbsp;its own NFTs, in which case an infringer could create a work that infringes copyright and then mint an NFT, offering it for sale. In this case, the rights owner may wish to ask the trading platform to remove the NFT from sale, as an infringement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Platforms like&nbsp;Rarible&nbsp;do state that they do abide by laws such as copyright, money laundering and fraud. In this instance, they will remove the NFT from their platform but the NFT will still exist on the blockchain and could be traded elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The additional question in this scenario is whether platforms&nbsp;like&nbsp;Rarible, could be encouraged to employ proper due diligence methods before allowing the creator to mint the NFT. For example,&nbsp;using&nbsp;image matching technology&nbsp;to determine if known works were copied.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-impersonation">Impersonation&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In early 2021, Banksy-style NFTs sold for $900,000. Given Banksy’s anonymity, buyers were not sure if this was the real Banksy or someone impersonating him. It turned out of be the latter.&nbsp;Domain names were registered such as banksynft.com and banksynfts.com, creating the possibility for further scams in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-copying-of-popular-nft-content">Copying of popular NFT content&nbsp;</h3>



<p>As mentioned, the content and NFT are held separately and access to the content is not necessarily limited to the owner of the NFT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should be a consideration when thinking about the long-term value of the NFT. If it is very easy to copy the content and anyone can obtain it then it may not be as valuable on resale. Retaining value really relies on creating a strong collectibles market, with value lying in scarcity.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-fake-nft-stores">Fake NFT stores&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Copying legitimate NFT trading platforms like&nbsp;Rarible, buyers may be tricked into giving their personal information and potentially funds to a platform that looks exactly like a well-known and legitimate platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-replica-nft-stores">Replica NFT stores&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Similar to the fake NFT stores, new stores could be created which are pure scams. They will have been set up to look like the next trading platform, but provide no functionality and harvest personal information and perhaps funds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-how-can-brand-protection-technology-support-nfts">How can brand protection&nbsp;technology&nbsp;support NFTs?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The emerging world of NFTs is an important aspect to be considered&nbsp;for many&nbsp;brand protection strategies. Whether minting and selling official NFTs or continuing to protect copyright assets, it is important that technology helps to combat new threats&nbsp;by:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Monitoring&nbsp;for domains that appear to be NFT trading/minting platforms which&nbsp;may be used to scam users and ensure&nbsp;discovery of URLs within that domain&nbsp;which may be offering NFTs infringing on&nbsp;the brand&nbsp;</li><li>Monitoring&nbsp;for domains that are purporting&nbsp;to be official NFT stores for the brand&nbsp;</li><li>Scraping&nbsp;legitimate platforms to find fake&nbsp;NFTs or otherwise infringing works that&nbsp;have been minted and make use of our&nbsp;imaging technology to detect any&nbsp;substantial copying of protected works&nbsp;</li><li>Tracking&nbsp;legitimate NFT content to&nbsp;determine if there is widescale&nbsp;distribution that would erode value&nbsp;</li><li>It’s also important&nbsp;for brand protection teams&nbsp;to build&nbsp;relationships with platforms to ensure they have&nbsp;effective takedown&nbsp;procedures in place, and are&nbsp;considering proactive measures to&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;the&nbsp;minting and sale of infringing&nbsp;NFTs.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>With insights from Phil Lewis, Director General at the Anti-Counterfeiting Group (ACG), and Marilyn Krige, Senior Global Brand Protection Counsel Anti-Counterfeiting at Reckitt, we explore how counterfeiting has evolved and why agile ‘organized crime groups’ (OCGs) often pose the greatest threat to businesses, local authorities and, ultimately, consumers.</strong></p>



<p>Read this piece to learn the attributes and behaviors of modern-day counterfeiters and how your business can fight back to protect your consumers and retain revenue streams.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-how-counterfeiter-behavior-has-evolved">How counterfeiter behavior has evolved&nbsp; </h2>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>“To understand how counterfeiting has changed, we need to look back to market reforms that took place in the 1990’s. Dissolved borders and more borderless markets dramatically changed the world in terms of illicit trade.”</strong> <br><br>&#8211; Phil Lewis, ACG</p>



<p>In addition to this, Phil notes that infringers have taken advantage of:</p>



<ul><li>the development and spread of digital technologies and e-commerce</li><li>the evolution of new and developed container freight systems and postal and courier services</li><li>reduced travel costs</li><li>more globalised banking systems, which means that huge sums can be moved across the world at lightning speed.</li></ul>



<p>This has resulted in alarmingly rapid growth in illegal markets, which attract and bring together new transnational crime networks.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, counterfeiters have expanded the scope and scale of their manufacturing from ‘traditional’ fake goods such as fashion, sports goods, and high-end watches, towards more fast-moving consumer goods, household products, and even medical appliances and treatments.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the ongoing pandemic has highlighted that the morality of criminals can sink to even lower levels. We have seen a huge increase in dangerous fakes including <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/six-warning-signs-to-spot-illegitimate-face-masks-hand-sanitizers/?preview_id=6745&amp;preview_nonce=861c4d46cd&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=6822">PPE</a> and medicines.</p>



<p>In the EU, over <strong>37%</strong> of products seized at the borders are potentially dangerous to consumers.</p>



<p>The perfect storm for businesses has now materialized due to the global health crisis; disposable income has suddenly become limited, with many consumers simply not having the same purchasing power, and counterfeiters have seized on gaps in supply. Shoppers will be on the lookout for low prices and deals, making themselves easy targets for counterfeiters who have stockpiled cheap, dangerous products.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Results of a poll of 64 Brand Protection professionals (16<sup>th</sup> July)</em></p>



<h3 id="h-the-challenges-facing-reckitt"><strong>The challenges facing Reckitt</strong></h3>



<p>Reckitt is a FMCG company with a large and diverse brand portfolio. Marilyn states that there are several key changes in the way infringers operate that pose unique Brand Protection challenges for the business:</p>



<ul type="1"><li><strong>How and where counterfeits are made &amp; how they are marketed</strong></li></ul>



<p>Manufacturing operations have moved away from China, into other regions in South East Asia due to cost and the imposition of increased intellectual property protections.</p>



<p>Many infringers have shifted to producing look-a-likes instead of counterfeits in an attempt to escape enforcement. They often use the RB’s brand imagery so are more difficult to spot using traditional techniques.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Ability to adapt business model and move online</strong></li></ul>



<p>There has been a convergence of counterfeiters’ online and offline presence, further increasing the complexity of illicit operations. The speed at which counterfeiters adapt continues to grow, with outside factors such as COVID not having any significant detrimental impact on the ability for operators to scale. These operators are agile and get products to market in record time without hindrance of regulation and other constraints.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Use of drop shipping to make source more difficult to identify</strong></li></ul>



<p>Sellers will often carry no stock but instead pass on order and shipping information to another seller, manufacturer, or other intermediary who then ships the product(s) directly to the consumer. This practice makes tracking the exact source and perpetrator difficult.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-the-rising-threat-of-organized-crime">The rising threat of organized crime</h2>



<p>The biggest challenge for businesses is tackling organized crime groups (OCGs) &#8212; also known as infringer networks &#8212; which are driving the global counterfeiting business.</p>



<p>Once they gain a foothold, these groups become more difficult to remove. They spot gaps when essential products are unavailable and move in. This was very clear during the recent lockdown restrictions.</p>



<p>Using a sophisticated network of seller accounts, websites, and social media profiles, they infiltrate the economy using illegal money, cement their positions, and scale globally.</p>



<p>Marilyn believes it is essential these illicit networks &#8212; often having multiple brands in their sights at any one time &#8212; are uncovered and taken down.</p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>“The level of sophistication has increased as printing quality and manufacturing quality have improved —</strong> <strong>so it&#8217;s easy for infringers to scale that over multiple brands.”</strong> <br><br>&#8211; Marilyn Krige, Reckitt</p>



<h3 id="h-how-infringer-networks-operate-across-borders-and-evade-enforcement-efforts">How infringer networks operate across borders and evade enforcement efforts&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Infringer networks have become more localized, decentralized, and specialized. In a swiftly developing global environment this has enabled them to engage professional facilitators, outside of their own countries, to quickly move products from one country to another. Working in this way, they can hide the source and reduce the prospect of detection.</p>



<p>Despite the size of this enormous global crimewave (US$509bn), there have been very few examples of a huge international organisation being in control. Instead, counterfeiters have developed small fluid networks to move fakes across borders. They operate in units, with cells that take on different functions, depending on their expertise and abilities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Results of a poll of 66 Brand Protection professionals (16<sup>th</sup> July)</em></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-online-sellers-are-borderless-brands-need-to-broaden-their-focus-across-geographies">Online sellers are borderless: Brands need to broaden their focus across geographies</h2>



<p>Brands with global reach expect to see their products to be infringed on a global scale. Businesses may focus on priority platforms such as eBay, Amazon, and Alibaba but overlook the volume and severity of infringements on more regional-based platforms that often serve whole continents.</p>



<p>Marilyn argues that the old adage ‘all big ideas start small’ applies to counterfeiters – what starts off as a small, irrelevant seller can soon spiral out of control into a wider region and take a share of an untapped market, eating away at potential sales.</p>



<p>RB takes a zero-tolerance approach to counterfeits in any country to prevent bad actors gaining a foothold and setting up larger manufacturing operations. Marilyn’s team keeps a constant eye on traditionally ‘clean’ platforms and marketplaces in all territories to spot any sudden spikes in infringement.</p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>“Businesses need to look at new ways to deal with infringements, such as&nbsp;the policies of the marketplaces and&nbsp;regulatory landscape.&#8221; </strong><br><br>&#8211; Marilyn Krige, Reckitt</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-building-a-united-front-against-counterfeiters">Building a united front against counterfeiters</h2>



<p>Firstly, businesses need to work harder to convince individual governments to properly accept the threat and then raise it to international security levels.</p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>“We must drive home greater understanding that this is no longer a problem for individual states and agencies.”</strong><br><br>&#8211; Phil Lewis, ACG</p>



<p>A unified, strategic approach will then foster more effective cross-border and inter-agency actions to break the current financial strength of organized crime, which use the profits from counterfeiting to feed other insidious forms of trafficking.</p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>“The ACG take a lead role on intelligence-led actions against some of the most notorious UK markets and online traders.”</strong><br><br>&#8211; Phil Lewis, ACG</p>



<p>By taking this approach, the ACG can gather, collate, analyse and package intelligence from its members and other sources. Then can then identify appropriate enforcement partners to take direct action.</p>



<p>However, counterfeiting cannot be effectively combatted through tactical enforcement alone. Consequently, the ACG are heavily involved in outreach with numerous government initiatives such as Anti-Illicit Trade Group, the EU Observatory on Infringements of IP rights, the EU Customs Working group, and the World Customs Organisation. Moreover, the ACG have built closer links to the OECD, RUSI, the Europol IC3 Unit, Interpol, UNICRI and various EU Commission services.</p>

<p>Taking on modern-day counterfeiters and winning is no mean feat. You’ll need advanced detection technology plus the capability to connect and prioritize networks of infringers to truly make an impact.</p>



<p>As infringers have evolved, so too has Incopro. We have built new features into <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Talisman</a>, our Brand Protection platform, to stay ahead of threats across channels and territories and enable enforcement at scale.</p>



<h3 id="h-discover-hidden-counterfeiters-and-infringers">Discover hidden counterfeiters and infringers</h3>



<p>We’ve developed optical character recognition (OCR) capability to discover hidden infringements. OCR ensures we collect all text that has been embedded in images by sellers attempting to avoid keyword detection.</p>



<p>As noted earlier, infringers may opt to sell lookalike products rather than counterfeits in an attempt to avoid enforcement. Talisman’s similar matching capability is able to identify and match these products based on an extensive brand image library. ​</p>



<h3 id="h-network-analysis-to-connect-and-prioritize-infringements"><strong>Network analysis to connect and prioritize infringements</strong></h3>



<p>We link related infringing entities together and identify those at the center of infringer networks – regardless of whether they are localized or cross-border operations.</p>



<p>Talisman’s Network Analysis capability connects networks of bad actors together and prioritizes them based on the threat posed to a brand. By scanning global, local, existing, and emerging platforms and matching key identifying information, we uncover the size and reach of the network and identify the perpetrators responsible, allowing businesses to take targeted action online or offline.</p>
