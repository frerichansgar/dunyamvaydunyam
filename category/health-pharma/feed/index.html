										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>As we begin to slowly emerge from the shadow of COVID-19, consumers still need to be vigilant of scams and fake products offered by bad actors online. And pharmaceutical companies that are producing life-saving vaccines have now emerged as the next big target for criminal operations.</strong></p>



<p>Bad actors have once again shifted focus, moving on from COVID-19 testing kits to selling fake vaccines, hijacking pharmaceutical brand names, and spreading disinformation.</p>



<p>Incopro’s Brand Protection experts have highlighted three key issues online:</p>



<ul type="1" class="branded-bullet-list"><li>1. Listings for COVID vaccines on B2B and B2C marketplaces</li><li>2. Criminals selling COVID-related products – including fake vaccine passports, ID cards, and test results</li><li>3. Fake social media pages using COVID vaccine brand names</li></ul>



<p>Law enforcement agencies such as Interpol have been actively investigating vaccination scams online and enforcing on behalf of pharmaceutical brands. However, they are unable to take on bad actors alone. Stronger collaboration between platforms, lawmakers, public health bodies, and brands is needed to safeguard consumers.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-1-listings-for-covid-vaccines-on-b2b-and-b2c-marketplaces">1. Listings for COVID vaccines on B2B and B2C marketplaces</h2>



<p>According to cyber security researchers, the number of adverts seen for vaccines on hacking forums and other marketplaces has tripled to more than 1,200 since January<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>



<p>Incopro’s experts have detected several unauthorized listings claiming to be ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Direct Suppliers’ on B2B platforms EC21, Ecplaza, and Tradekey. With the listings not directly referring to branded vaccines, identifying the key platforms sellers use to advertise these fake or unauthorized products plays a significant role in proactive enforcement.</p>

<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>COVID vaccine listings can often also be found on B2C platforms such as eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist. These usually involve sellers offering slots to get the vaccine. COVID vaccine manufacturers have confirmed to Incopro that the majority of these online offers are scams.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Examples of unauthorized listings on B2C marketplaces</p>



<p>In February 2021, authorities in China arrested the leader of a multi-million-dollar vaccine scam. The individual responsible had researched the packaging designs of legitimate vaccines before producing over 58,000 solutions that simply contained saline solution and mineral water<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>. Alarmingly, a batch of the fake vaccines were smuggled overseas, and their destination is still unknown.</p>



<p>It is critical that platforms work with brands to have these types of listings removed swiftly. As long as vaccine listings remain visible on a platform, consumers are put at serious risk of being scammed, damage is being inflicted on the vaccine manufacturers’ brand, and global vaccination programs are in danger of being undermined by queue cutting.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-2-criminals-selling-covid-related-products">2. Criminals selling COVID-related products</h2>



<p>With plans for vaccine passports and identity cards to be adopted in the months ahead, some bad actors are looking to get ahead of the game. Fake identity cards, vaccine passports/certificates, and even test results are being sold on e-commerce websites and, increasingly, the dark web[3].</p>



<p>These types of fake goods are particularly dangerous, as unscrupulous individuals could use them to fraudulently gain access to COVID-secure venues and to travel abroad &#8211; with the real risk they could be carrying the virus.</p>



<p>Law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Drug Agency in the US (FDA) are pursuing false COVID-related products and are notifying registrars when their services are used by bad actors. However, with over 1,000 COVID-related domains being registered per day[4], registrars need to do more; they should not be waiting to be notified by brand owners or law enforcement before acting.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-3-fake-social-media-pages-using-covid-vaccine-brand-names">3. Fake social media pages using COVID vaccine brand names</h2>



<p>In October 2020<em>, </em>Incopro’s experts identified a private ‘investment study’ group on Facebook with over 1000 members using a vaccine manufacturers brand name. As this type of social media activity is not authorized, it is important to remove these pages to ensure that only factual information regarding the vaccines is circulated.</p>



<p>Other fake social media pages have been set up with the sole intention of scamming consumers. In August 2020, the HMRC (UK) reported it was currently investigating over 10,000 COVID-related phishing scams[5].</p>



<p>Fake social media pages with COVID vaccine brand names have also be set up with the intention of spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. It is critical that platforms are able to identify and remove these groups before they contribute irreversible damage to public health and trust in global vaccination programs.</p>



<p>Incopro’s experts have even come across instances of fake social media accounts set impersonating members of leadership teams at vaccine manufacturers, with the intention of gleaning sensitive business information.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-platforms-have-a-key-role-to-play">Platforms have a key role to play</h2>



<p>While listings for fake vaccines and other illegitimate COVID-related products are eventually removed, marketplaces have been criticised for being acting too slowly, thus putting consumers and brands at risk.</p>



<p>Throughout the pandemic, social media platforms have also come under fire for their slow removal of vaccine and COVID-19 disinformation (false or misleading information that is deliberately created / shared to cause harm[6]). Recently, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have publicly committed to stricter controls on COVID disinformation &#8211; and misinformation (false or misleading information that is unwittingly created or shared without meaning to cause harm[7]).</p>



<p>In March, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed US lawmakers&nbsp;on the variety of tools deployed by the social media platform to prevent harmful misinformation about COVID-19 from spreading. During the last 12 months, Facebook has partnered with over 60 global health experts to provide accurate information surrounding COVID-19 and vaccines. In December 2020, the platform announced that all vaccine misinformation would be banned. Users who violate the policy will be suspended and eventually banned if they continue to flout the rules<sup>[8]</sup>.</p>



<p>However, certain types of misinformation that is shared by individual accounts rather than large groups &#8211; such as personal anecdotes on vaccine side-effects and effectiveness – pose a grey area to platforms. This misinformation is usually left unmoderated without public health warnings attached.</p>



<p>With roughly <strong>30%</strong> of Americans&nbsp;continuing to express some hesitancy around getting a COVID vaccine<sup>[9]</sup>, platforms, lawmakers, public health bodies, and vaccine manufacturers need to work together to tackle disinformation, misinformation, and fake COVID products.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-can-pharmaceutical-brands-do">What can pharmaceutical brands do?</h2>



<p>Automated Brand Protection technology is critical to discovering, prioritizing, and actioning online threats. Alongside sophisticated keyword matching, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/advanced-image-capabilities/">image matching and OCR capabilities</a> help brands discover bad actors that avoid using brand-related keywords.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Protecting consumers and your reputation is critical to e-commerce success. A focused, deliberative strategy is needed to reduce infringement on key platforms and tackle large-scale criminal operators.</strong></p>



<p>We discuss how to prioritize and work with key platforms to reduce the volume of infringement. We then guide you through the tools at your disposal, allowing you to deliver against your Brand Protection goals.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-1-how-to-prioritize-platforms-to-review" style="color:#009ca6">Part 1: How to prioritize platforms to review</h2>



<p>It’s important to pick your battles and focus on&nbsp;threats that are&nbsp;most&nbsp;damaging to your brand&nbsp;and&nbsp;also&nbsp;where you are&nbsp;most&nbsp;likely to see ROI from your enforcement action.&nbsp;While Incopro discovers, prioritizes, and acts against infringements across platforms of all sizes, we find that over 80% of&nbsp;high-risk&nbsp;infringements occur&nbsp;on around 20 key platforms.</p>



<p>When&nbsp;determining your focus there are three key points to consider:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-1-protect-consumers-and-brand-value-eliminate-counterfeit-product-visible-to-potential-consumer">1. Protect consumers&nbsp;and brand value:&nbsp;eliminate counterfeit product visible to potential consumer&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Understand where your potential consumers shop.&nbsp;A good starting point is to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;key popular e-commerce platforms in each&nbsp;market&nbsp;and keep them clean from infringing product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep an eye on the emerging platforms: the way consumers shop online is constantly evolving.&nbsp;Social Commerce is not a new concept, but COVID-19 has really&nbsp;accelerated&nbsp;the process &#8211;&nbsp;2020 could be the year&nbsp;to watch as many&nbsp;social media&nbsp;platforms are&nbsp;investing in seamless&nbsp;commerce&nbsp;experiences.</p>



<h4 id="h-2-protect-your-own-e-commerce-channels-and-support-authorized-partners-eliminate-consumer-diversion-from-official-selling-channels">2. Protect your own e-commerce channels and support authorized partners: eliminate consumer diversion from official selling channels:&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong>Protect Official Websites:</strong>&nbsp;the majority of&nbsp;consumers are likely arriving at your website via organic or paid searches for your brand&nbsp;and products. Focus&nbsp;on first pages of Search Engines&nbsp;and&nbsp;Paid Search&nbsp;results;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Official Social Media Channels:</strong> audit social media platforms to eliminate impersonating pages and ads that cause consumer confusion;</p>



<p><strong>Official and authorised Marketplace stores:</strong> focus on marketplace platforms where your brands have their own stores. Focus on top pages of results, top selling products and categories, sponsored listings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a good place to engage your e-commerce and marketing teams&nbsp;that are likely to be the first ones to see the benefits of your enforcement efforts and be advocates of your brand protection program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-3-tackle-the-source-of-the-problem">3. Tackle the source of the&nbsp;problem:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Focus on the platforms in the regions known for manufacturing counterfeits.&nbsp;B2B&nbsp;platforms and wholesalers are often the source of the counterfeit product ending up on the consumer facing markets.</p>



<h4 id="h-take-a-strategic-approach-to-platform-enforcement">Take a strategic approach to platform enforcement</h4>



<p>Concentrating&nbsp;enforcement&nbsp;efforts on priority platforms and&nbsp;priority&nbsp;concerns will lead to&nbsp;better Brand Protection outcomes. The more you focus on a platform and knock-out infringement networks, the more effective your enforcement will be, allowing you to establish an effective deterrent against them coming back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is best to carve out specific goals around specific platforms, brands, products, IP, infringement types, etc. and to try to tackle the specific problem fully with the aim of sending a clear, credible message to counterfeiters.</p>

<p>Once you’ve narrowed down the focus of your Brand Protection program, you&nbsp;need to&nbsp;consider the strategy that will allow you to&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;balance the&nbsp;two aspects:&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-1-reduce-visibility-of-counterfeit-products-b2c">1. Reduce&nbsp;visibility of counterfeit products&nbsp;(B2C):&nbsp;</h4>



<ul><li>Infringing offers on first pages of results that divert attention from genuine product&nbsp;</li><li>Sponsored&nbsp;ads and&nbsp;listings&nbsp;as these are more likely to confuse the consumer&nbsp;</li><li>Good metrics:&nbsp;Some marketplaces platforms (e.g. eBay, AliExpress) share information on the number of transactions made on a listing. The offers with highest sales transactions are more likely to be visible to consumer.&nbsp;</li><li>Users and Sellers with high number of&nbsp;Likes, Favourites, and Followers&nbsp;have large audience and are more damaging&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-2-remove-large-scale-infringers-b2c-and-b2b">2. Remove&nbsp;large scale infringers&nbsp;(B2C and&nbsp;B2B):</h4>



<ul><li>Sellers with large volume of&nbsp;stock&nbsp;</li><li>Sellers with&nbsp;large&nbsp;numbers&nbsp;of&nbsp;infringing&nbsp;listings&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Sellers operating via multiple channels&nbsp;</li><li>Re-offenders</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-3-tips-for-working-with-the-e-commerce-giants-amazon-ebay-alibaba-facebook" style="color:#009ca6">Part 3:&nbsp;Tips for working with the e-commerce giants – Amazon, eBay, Alibaba &amp;&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;</h2>



<p>You need to work with the e-commerce and social media giants, plus other platforms, to get results.&nbsp;Most&nbsp;global&nbsp;platforms already have&nbsp;established processes and&nbsp;IP reporting tools available:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Amazon: Online Portal and Brand Registry&nbsp;together with other piloted projects like Amazon Project Zero&nbsp;</li><li>eBay:&nbsp;VeRO&nbsp;program&nbsp;</li><li>Alibaba IPP&nbsp;platform&nbsp;</li><li>Facebook&nbsp;has the webforms&nbsp;and Commerce and Ads IP tool&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>These tools allow brand owners and their agents to report such IP infringements&nbsp;as&nbsp;counterfeits and misuse of trademarks and copyright imagery. With time we see these tools evolve to address new infringer behavior with pressure from the brand owners.</p>



<p>Examples of this include the Facebook Commerce&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ads&nbsp;IP tool that identifies infringing ads on Facebook and Instagram and changes to the Amazon Brand Registry to address&nbsp;broader marketplace&nbsp;policy violations and introduce AI features to assist with proactive monitoring.</p>



<h4 id="h-platform-limitations">Platform limitations</h4>



<p>Unfortunately, these&nbsp;tools are not fully caught up to provide a&nbsp;robust&nbsp;response mechanism to emerging threats.</p>



<p>While the Amazon BR and Alibaba IPP tools are useful when it comes to sending out enforcements and getting items actioned quickly, they&nbsp;are not&nbsp;enough&nbsp;on their own because they do not provide robust capabilities for:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Collecting comprehensive data and getting&nbsp;visibility on the scale and types of problems on a platform.&nbsp;</li><li>Prioritization&#8211;organizing&nbsp;and grouping infringements for efficient&nbsp;enforcement;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Identifying infringement networks and recurring activity; and&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Maintaining records&nbsp;of the items that have been actioned&nbsp;and&nbsp;reporting.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Talisman, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Incopro’s Brand Protection platform</a>,&nbsp;is a complementary tool that ensures that brands have all the data they need related to infringements and a way to easily export material for efficient enforcement using the platform tools.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-4-how-to-address-new-threats-from-emerging-platforms" style="color:#009ca6">Part 4:&nbsp;How to address new threats from emerging platforms&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Social commerce is capturing demand for seamless consumer interactions, particularly from millennials and generation Z. Social media&nbsp;platforms are&nbsp;fast transforming from serving as a social marketing&nbsp;tool&nbsp;to&nbsp;e-commerce with users never having to leave the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The primary players in social commerce are Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook and now also&nbsp;TikTok.&nbsp;TikTok, for example,&nbsp;has started to allow some users to add links to e-commerce sites to their profile biography as well as the ability to easily send their viewers to shopping websites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumers are also being pushed to other platforms, including standalone e-commerce shops, such as Shopify which are easy to set up and maintain.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-strong-platform-relationships-are-essential">Strong platform relationships are essential</h4>



<p>Many platforms claim they are not in a position to police themselves, both in terms of labor and technology capabilities, and the burden is still on IP owners to report&nbsp;the infringements.&nbsp;Maintaining strong relationships with both established and emerging platforms is therefore critical to successfully reducing infringement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brands should engage with platforms regularly and have direct contact with their&nbsp;team to understand how they work, and&nbsp;to be able to provide feedback on what works well and what can improve. Compliance and platform response times improve when you take the time to educate the platform about your brands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see that infringers behavior is&nbsp;constantly&nbsp;evolving and&nbsp;they adopt to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;detection and&nbsp;enforcement.&nbsp;The ability to alert and advise platforms on these trends is essential to keeping up with bad actors.</p>



<p>When engaging emerging platforms, we suggest taking the following approach as part of your relationship building exercise:</p>



<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts: support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;</li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;</li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h2>



<ul type="1"><li><strong>Consider which&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;to&nbsp;tackle&nbsp;first based on where your consumers are, the volume of issues, your commercial objectives&nbsp;and how much impact you need to make to reduce your problem.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Engage with the platforms in a positive way, embrace their tools and&nbsp;give them&nbsp;feedback&nbsp;about&nbsp;where you would like to see them improve.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Keep an eye on the new and emerging platforms&nbsp;in case you need to add those to your top&nbsp;platform list.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>With the huge challenges facing all businesses as the world rapidly moves to online retail, consumer trust in digital channels is critical. There has never been a more important time to revisit how you approach protecting your brand and consumers on e-commerce platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Counterfeiters and other online bad actors are opportunistic at their core and will seize on any chance to make a quick profit out of unsuspecting consumers. The COVID-19 crisis is no different, with bad actors swift to list both medical products and everyday consumer items at marked-up prices as demand skyrockets.</strong></p>



<p>Price gouging refers to the act of exploiting consumers during an external crisis by charging excessive prices for products far above the market rate. During the COVID-19 crisis, price gouging has been observed on B2C marketplaces and websites by distributors and private sellers. Many countries have anti-price gouging legislation to protect consumers during national emergencies, but even where protections do not exist platforms will often prohibit the practice.</p>



<p>In April, Amazon claimed it had removed more than half a million COVID-related items and suspended more than 6,000 sellers across its global marketplaces after infringing its price gouging rules[1].</p>



<p>In an unusual step, Amazon has even gone as far as requesting new legislation to be drafted with VP of Public Policy Brian Huseman calling on Congress to make price gouging illegal during a national crisis[2]. The executive notes that similar laws already exist at state level and are effective at fighting bad actors online.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 crisis has seen a dramatic increase in price gouging on a wide range of products, including those that consumers are more reliant on than ever: pharmaceuticals, hygiene products, and medical equipment. This piece looks at the data, providing analysis of the scale of the issue, before sharing insights into how your business can tackle this growing threat effectively.</p>



<h3>Price gouging pharmaceuticals: Exploiting vulnerable consumers</h3>



<p>COVID-19 related price gouging was first identified on marketplace listings for pharmaceuticals and other medical equipment supplies. Globally, enforcement agencies and regional authorities are looking to demonstrate their vigilance to the public in this climate and are watching for price hikes.</p>

<p>Talisman, Incopro’s Brand Protection platform, has identified rampant price gouging in recent weeks &#8211; which were then acted on by our analysts. These are just two of the countless infringing listings discovered:</p>



<ul><li>Price gouging of up to a staggering <strong>750%</strong> for a well-known painkiller with a box of 24 capsules on eBay for <strong>$329</strong> with no guarantee they are authentic.</li><li>Price gouging of up to <strong>100%</strong> for a global cold &amp; flu brand across key marketplaces around the world.</li></ul>



<p>Price gougers are exploiting vulnerable consumers who feel that they have little choice but to pay the hugely inflated prices for essential medical drugs and supplies.</p>



<h3><strong>Price gouging on consumer goods: Taking advantage of spikes in demand</strong></h3>



<p>The issue is not isolated to the health sector; we have also observed an increase in price gouging across a wide range of other product categories. Incopro’s Brand Protection experts harnessed Talisman to monitor these product categories on Amazon US for price gouging:</p>



<h4>Desks and computer monitors</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>desks</strong> and <strong>computer monitors</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings on average by <strong>193%</strong> since COIVD-19 hit. An example can be seen below, showing the increase in price listed by a third-party seller for a desk from the beginning of the year to now, clearly taking advantage of the crisis.</p>



<p>One listing for a simple home-working desk saw a large price increase of <strong>247%</strong>, going from <strong>$89</strong> to <strong>$220</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1000" height="476" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020.jpg" alt="Price fluctuations on home office furniture sold on Amazon.com (May 2020)" class="wp-image-8072" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020.jpg 1000w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption>Price fluctuations on home office furniture sold on Amazon.com (May 2020)</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Sports and exercise equipment</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>bench presses</strong> and <strong>yoga mats</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings by <strong>168%</strong> on average since COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>One listing saw a large price increase of <strong>370%</strong>, going from <strong>$160</strong> to <strong>$330</strong>. This screenshot of a customer review from March 2020 shows that the product listed was cheap and potentially harmful, yet concedes that there’s ‘slim pickings’ due to the pandemic’s effect on supply:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1378" height="345" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020.png" alt="Amazon customer review for bench press (March 2020)" class="wp-image-8074" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020.png 1378w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-300x75.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-1024x256.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-768x192.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1378px) 100vw, 1378px" /><figcaption>Amazon customer review for bench press (March 2020)</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Home entertainment</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>a leading games console</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings by <strong>161%</strong> since COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>This data shows that sellers are taking advantage of COVID-19 to increase the prices of their listings, with all categories showing sellers increasing their prices by over <strong>150%</strong> since the crisis has hit.</p>



<h3>The threat to consumer safety and brand reputation</h3>



<p>Not only do consumers face the prospect of massively overpaying for a product, there is also a chance that the products they are purchasing are already used[3] – meaning consumers are not getting what they paid for, or even non-genuine – putting consumers at risk of physical harm.</p>



<p>Brands face a two-fold issue with price gouging:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Policing distributors that are selling genuine product far above the market rate/agreed price</li><li>Removing copycat/counterfeit products that use the brand’s IP and are sold far above the market rate</li></ol>



<p>Price gouging damages brand reputation and consumer trust in a brand, regardless if the product on offer is genuine. Distributors of the products will not face the brunt of your reputational damage, even if they are the party engaging in price gouging. Any damage is likely to be long-term and extremely difficult to repair.</p>



<p>In April, Incopro polled 87 business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, asking about what they perceived to be the biggest risk to their businesses due to COVID-19 – over&nbsp;<strong>45%</strong>&nbsp;said the risk to consumer trust and the consumer-to-brand relationship. This highlights that they recognize the risk that the shift in market dynamic has created.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Platforms cannot tackle the threat alone</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve noted that some platforms are taking action, and governments are setting up dedicated &#8216;price gouging&#8217; taskforces &#8211; but they are unable to stem the tide alone. Amazon, for example, will actively monitor for price gouging, but due to the scale of the problem and the limits of their technology may be slow to identity and remove infringements. However, if they are notified by a brand of specific instances of price gouging, they will be able to act far swifter.</p>



<p>Incopro’s Brand Protection technology and expert analysts give you cross-platform, cross-territory insights into price gouging with a tried and tested online enforcement solution delivered at scale directly from the platform. The platform can also collate evidence packs for injunctions and wider monetary relief. and bespoke reporting by brand, platform, territory provides internal stakeholders with valuable sales insights.</p>



<p>Price gouging is not a new phenomenon – it existed before COVID-19 and will continue even as the global crisis eventually subsides. By taking a strong stance now, you can put consumer safety at the heart of your Brand Protection strategy.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Bad actors are exploiting the COVID-19 crisis by infiltrating the digital channels consumers now rely on. Learn how Brand Protection can provide maximum value – protecting consumers and brands – with a strategic, refocused approach.</strong></p>



<p>Consumer behavior is evolving rapidly, and we should anticipate an enduring shift of purchasing habits online. The increased time spent across all digital channels exposes consumers to increased risks – a level of risk that they would not be facing when visiting physical retail stores.</p>



<h3>Fast heading towards a new normal</h3>



<p>The ‘new normal’, a phrase that is fast entering common parlance, is being used to describe social distancing measures and other behaviors that will likely be necessary for an extended period. But this phrase also applies to consumer buying habits and the future of e-commerce, with the pandemic likely to have a profound, permanent impact on where consumers decide to purchase the brands that they love.</p>



<p>While tourism has seen a huge slump, the majority of sectors have seen online sales growth as displayed below. Consumers still require the vast majority of products that they purchased pre-COVID-19 – they are just pivoting to new channels to acquire them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="998" height="406" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19.png" alt="Heading towards the New Normal - Online sales growth during COVID-19" class="wp-image-7705" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19.png 998w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19-300x122.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19-768x312.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px" /></figure>



<p>The shift online will not replace offline spend across all sectors but represents a material change in consumers’ expectations of brands. We would have expected e-commerce as a share of retail in the US to drop after the usual Q4 peak, but as seen in the graph below it has continued to grow after the Q4 2019 peak through Q1 2020.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="560" height="410" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ecommerce-as-a-share-of-retail-2015-2019.png" alt="Ecommerce as a share of retail 2015-2019" class="wp-image-7706" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ecommerce-as-a-share-of-retail-2015-2019.png 560w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ecommerce-as-a-share-of-retail-2015-2019-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></figure>



<p style="color:#009ca6;font-size:18px" class="has-text-color"><strong>“It’s very likely that these behaviors will continue, even when the coronavirus pandemic eventually subsides. Why? Because ecommerce habits tend to form during periods of intense activity, and those habits already have momentum, they come even stickier.”</strong></p>



<p> &#8211; Andrew Lipsman, eMarketer</p>



<h3>Bad actors have reacted swiftly to the COVID-19 crisis</h3>



<p>Counterfeiters and other bad actors are agile operators, reacting to the crisis by creating new products to meet increased demand, often as lookalike brands rather than direct counterfeits to avoid detection.</p>



<p>Talisman, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Incopro’s Brand Protection platform</a>, discovered 20,000 units of counterfeit sanitizer sold on 1 Alibaba listing in a month, almost all sold to the US.</p>



<p>Brands otherwise unrelated to COVID-19 and hygiene are equally targeted by bad actors intending to capitalize on increased demand for hygiene goods, such as these fake face masks seen below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1014" height="400" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7711" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon.png 1014w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon-300x118.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon-768x303.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px" /><figcaption>Fake &#8216;branded&#8217; face masks seen on Amazon.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bad actors have also increased supply of genuine critical medicines in line with news events and are selling at vastly inflated prices; supply has increased as the lockdown has endured. Incopro has monitored high-risk listings in the US for a painkiller brand between February and April. See the below graph that illustrates this disturbing trend in the US and maps it against key milestones during the crisis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="759" height="376" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/High-risk-detections-in-USA-for-painkiller-brand.png" alt="High risk detections in USA for painkiller brand" class="wp-image-7720" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/High-risk-detections-in-USA-for-painkiller-brand.png 759w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/High-risk-detections-in-USA-for-painkiller-brand-300x149.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /></figure>



<p>Price gouging has been rampant throughout the crisis, with standard packs of painkillers such as the brand monitored above sold for up to US$999.</p>



<p>As expected, bad actors have adapted their behavior to avoid traditional detection techniques in the way they list products and the way they utilize digital channels. Businesses need to keep up if they are to protect their consumers and digital revenues.</p>



<h3>All types of online brand abuse are on the rise</h3>



<p>Brands are seeing ‘traditional’ types of online brand abuse increase, regardless of whether the product’s design or description can be linked to COVID-19.</p>



<p>Listings for non-genuine goods have increased for a wide range of products unrelated to hygiene as counterfeiters look to capitalize on increased online shopping. Since December 2019, for example, Incopro’s Talisman software has detected:</p>



<ul><li>A 94%&nbsp;increase in non-genuine listings of home appliance products &amp; spare parts since December 2019</li><li>A 51%&nbsp;increase in non-genuine listings of sporting goods and running shoes since December 2019</li><li>A 45%&nbsp;increase in non-genuine listings of high-end, luxury shoes since December 2019</li></ul>



<h3>Consumer trust is under threat in the long term</h3>



<p>On April 29, Incopro polled 87 business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, asking about what they perceived to be the biggest risk to their businesses due to COVID-19 &#8211; over <strong>45%</strong> said the risk to consumer trust and the consumer to brand relationship. This highlights that they are recognizing the risk that the shift in market dynamic has created.</p>



<p> Criminal activity that damages consumer trust online, such as phishing schemes and financial scams, is now being seen as a critical issue facing businesses. We are seeing businesses that would not traditionally face high volumes of online scams using their brand and IP now entering the crosshairs of online criminals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="864" height="148" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7700" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams.png 864w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams-300x51.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams-768x132.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /><figcaption>Data sourced from Google’s ‘Transparency Report’ tool and a report released by Barclays in April 2020.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Take Morrisons, a leading UK grocery store, for example. During the initial stockpiling period of the crisis, Incopro analysts discovered a phishing scheme targeting Morrisons’ customers that posed as an online competition to win unlimited groceries. The linked website asked consumers to enter their personal details and was connected to multiple social media pages and accounts, including a Facebook page. The latter accrued over&nbsp;<strong>5.9k</strong>&nbsp;followers before it was eventually removed by the platform.</p>



<p>Counterfeiters have responded rapidly to increased demand for many categories and will react to future changes in consumer behavior. There has been a significant increase in all forms of brand abuse that threaten consumers’ trust in brands – <a>businesses need to </a>maintain the valuable relationships they have built through omnichannel touchpoints over a long period of time.</p>



<h3>Build the internal case for Brand Protection</h3>



<p>Those responsible for protecting consumers should take focus on <strong>three key actions</strong> that will support awareness and effectiveness in the current climate and beyond.</p>



<ul type="1"><li><strong>Build internal coalition</strong></li></ul>



<p>Build working groups including ecommerce, marketing &amp; security across function and ensure all relevant parties are engaged &amp; aligned</p>



<ul><li><strong>Communicate to senior leadership</strong></li></ul>



<p>Proactively report value &amp; risks to senior leadership around business outcomes: customer safety, revenue &amp; trust</p>



<ul><li><strong>Articulate the full business value of brand protection</strong></li></ul>



<p>Where budgets are under pressure or increased investment is needed, it is critical that the full value of brand protection is understood.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Strategic initiatives for your Brand Protection program</h2>



<p>With the huge challenges facing all businesses &#8211; bricks &amp; mortar retail channels shutting down, workforces operating remotely, and the furloughing of staff – consumer trust in digital channels is critical to survival. There has never been a more important time to protect your brand and consumers online.</p>



<p>In the same poll of business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, we asked whether their business had altered strategy in the face of changing consumer behavior – over <strong>85%</strong> said&nbsp;they had already made changes or were planning to, and only <strong>1%</strong> stated they did not plan to make any changes.</p>



<p>The blueprint for Brand Protection success will vary by business and sector, but there are five key levers for actions you should be taking:</p>



<p style="color:#009ca6" class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. Align with key sales channels to capture online revenue</strong></p>



<p>Align Brand Protection strategies with ecommerce to focus on key products, territories &amp; platforms</p>



<p style="color:#009ca6" class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. Prioritize in line with consumer behavior to protect trust</strong></p>



<p>Focus enforcement on what the consumer sees &amp; buys – prioritize to listing spots &amp; owning key social channels</p>



<p style="color:#009ca6" class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Re-allocate resources from offline to online</strong></p>



<p>Leverage offline budgets to increase online focus. If not possible, consider pooling budgets with other functions</p>



<p style="color:#009ca6" class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. Ensure that COVID-19 related threats are addressed as critical business issues</strong></p>



<p>Reputational risk is significant &amp; these issues should be flagged to senior leadership and mitigated rapidly</p>



<p style="color:#009ca6" class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. Review monitoring approach to address evolving infringer behavior</strong></p>



<p>Ensure your solution captures threats such as lookalikes and techniques such as hiding text in images</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:22px"><strong>The COVID-19 crisis has revealed the best and the worst in humanity. Heroic efforts by healthcare workers have been seen across the globe. However, these efforts are being constantly undermined by bad actors looking to exploit huge spikes in demand for products such as hand sanitizer and face masks.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us/">Independent market research commissioned by Incopro</a> found that 34% of US consumers believe fake pharmaceutical products pose the greatest threat to consumers today versus other ‘fake’ goods and information available online (sample included: social media accounts, reviews, news, and several product categories).</p>



<p>At a time where consumers are less likely to be cautious when purchasing these types of products, the danger could not be more real. News continues to pour in of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52288675" target="_blank">fake personal COVID-19 testing kits</a> being intercepted throughout the world. Whereas authorities in China have continued to battle counterfeit face masks, having <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-china-confiscated-over-31-million-counterfeit-face-masks-report-2020-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confiscated over 31 million fake masks at the end of February</a>.</p>



<p>Incopro research finds that<strong> 83%</strong> of US consumers look for warning signs when shopping online.&nbsp;However, while they claim to compare prices with going market rates (<strong>31%</strong>), consider the legitimacy of a website (<strong>25%</strong>), read customer reviews (<strong>45%</strong>), and look at the country of the product/seller (<strong>32%</strong>), the COVID-19 crisis has thrown buyer caution to the wind. Consumers are more likely to purchase first and think later as they compete with others for scarce goods and products that now hold increased perceived value such as face masks and hand sanitizer.</p>



<h3>The ecommerce boom</h3>



<p>With a large percentage of the US population now working from home and social distancing measures in place, there will be a tectonic move towards e-commerce. Online shopping trends observed during holidays suggests that change in behavior may be part of a step-change and may become the new normal even after the crisis eventually subsides.</p>



<p>Online shopping is increasing across all countries. However increases have been seen most where lockdown measures have been tightest (for the longest period of time) – <strong>18%</strong> of UK consumers &amp; <strong>23%</strong> of US consumers said they had increased online shopping to date for things they previously bought in shops, vs. <strong>31%</strong> in Italy and <strong>50%</strong> in China, according to a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-03/tracking-the-coronavirus-wave4-ipsos.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ipsos Mori survey conducted in March</a>. We can expect more European countries and the US to increase online shopping as they get used to lockdown procedures and the more prolonged social distancing measures.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/how-ecommerce-platforms-facilitate-online-counterfeiting/">Online marketplaces have become a hotbed for&nbsp;counterfeit sellers</a>, steering customers to their own products by undercutting the prices of the legitimate items. Over the last couple of years, both government and online marketplaces in China have adopted a tougher stance against counterfeiters and other types of brand abuse. As a result, many of the bad actors operating out of China that once frequented platforms such as Taobao and AliExpress have now moved their operations to western marketplaces such as Amazon who have taken a less aggressive approach.</p>



<h3>FAKE FACE MASKS</h3>



<p>As countries begin to shift their COVID-19 guidance and recommend that the general public wear face masks to slow the transmission of the virus, it is critical that the products being touted are genuine and certified for use.</p>



<p>According to Ipsos Mori, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en/more-people-say-theyre-wearing-masks-protect-themselves-covid-19-march" target="_blank"><strong>50%</strong> of US consumers now say they wear face masks to protect themselves</a> (survey conducted April 9-12) &nbsp;– an increase of <strong>38 </strong>percentage points versus last month (March 12-14).</p>



<p>In the first week of March <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Talisman</a>, Incopro&#8217;s Brand Protection platform, discovered over <strong>1,150</strong> social media posts on four key platforms (Facebook,<br>Twitter, Instagram, and Vkontakte) selling counterfeit respiratory masks – a 2,490% increase as compared to the minimal levels of similar posts in December 2019 before the pandemic.</p>



<p>Exploiting concerned members of the public, these untested, poor-quality face masks are highly unlikely to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="988" height="879" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Illegimate-facemasks_Source-NIOSH.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7377" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Illegimate-facemasks_Source-NIOSH.jpg 988w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Illegimate-facemasks_Source-NIOSH-300x267.jpg 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Illegimate-facemasks_Source-NIOSH-768x683.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /><figcaption>Source: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong>UNREGULATED HAND SANITIZERS</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Talisman</a> identified a <strong>270%</strong> increase in listings of non-genuine hygiene products such as hand sanitizers and anti-bacterial wipes in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019.</p>



<p>These products were untested, unregulated, and likely to be ineffective. Many of these listings contained false claims about being able to kill the coronavirus or protection against contracting the disease. </p>



<p>Furthermore, there has been an explosion in lookalike brands ripping off established brands health-related products, and unregulated sellers selling medicines at inflated prices that is unlikely to be genuine product.</p>



<p>With prices of products such as hand sanitizer increasing by the day as supply of verified brands struggle to keep up with demand, inflated prices of unknown and newly listed products are indicators that the goods may be illegitimate.</p>



<p>Hand sanitizers are drugs as defined by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration and are therefore subject to stringent regulations. It is highly likely that the non-branded products being listed on marketplaces do not adhere to these regulations and therefore put consumers at risk.</p>



<h3><strong>SPIKES IN ILLEGITIMATE GOODS: NON-HYGIENE PRODUCTS</strong></h3>



<p>Listings for non-genuine goods have increased for a range of products apparently unrelated to COVID-19 as counterfeiters look to capitalize on increased online shopping. Since December 2019, for example, Incopro’s Talisman software has detected:</p>



<ul><li><strong>94%</strong> increase in non-genuine listings of home appliance products &amp; spare parts since December 2019</li><li><strong>51% </strong>increase in non-genuine listings of sporting goods and running shoes since December 2019</li><li><strong>45%</strong> increase in non-genuine listings of high-end, luxury shoes since December 2019</li></ul>



<p>As the public adjusts to the ‘New Normal’ that <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/uk/en/insights/article/2020/covid-19-tracking-the-impact-on-fmcg-and-retail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nielsen forecasts</a> with increased levels of online consumption, it’s likely that more than the <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us/"><strong>26% </strong>of consumers who mistakenly bought a counterfeit online last year</a> will be deceived by bad actors in the future.</p>



<h3>PHISHING SCHEMES AND FAKE ADVERTISEMENTS</h3>



<p>Phishing schemes and fake news are also key issues facing brands during the pandemic.</p>



<p>While phishing sites often contain grammatical or spelling errors within the product information, many consumers still fall victim to these online scams. Often, bad actors deceive buyers by changing the spelling of a well-known brand or shop and including it in the website address. With the majority of bricks &amp; mortar stores forced to close temporarily, consumers will be looking for the brands&#8217; digital presence and will be highly susceptible to false association and scams.</p>



<p>In March, Incopro analysts discovered a phishing website that exploited the initial panic-buying that swept across the country by offering ‘unlimited’ groceries from Morrisons, a leading UK supermarket, to winners of an online competition. This website had multiple social media pages and accounts, including a Facebook page with that accrued over <strong>5.9k</strong> followers. This highlights how well-intentioned consumers are often duped by these criminal schemes.</p>



<h3>Consumers cannot be exposed to illegitimate products</h3>



<p>The sheer volume of illegitimate goods highlights the challenge facing brands and consumers during this global health crisis. It also displays the alarming ease in which can infiltrate the digital channels consumers rely on.</p>



<p>Consumers are unlikely to be aware of the full scale of the threat posed by counterfeits and other illegitimate goods online. And they should not be expected to take responsibility for weeding out the fakes from the real. Combatting counterfeits requires a concerted, joint effort from government and global health authorities, brands, and platforms.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Brand protection is more important than ever</h2>



<p>With the huge challenges facing all businesses &#8211; bricks &amp; mortar retail channels shutting down, workforces operating remotely, and the furloughing of staff &#8211; online revenue streams are critical to survival. There has never been a more important time to protect your brand and consumers online.</p>



<p>By dedicating resources to safeguarding consumers and making changes to digital strategy, brand abuse will not be able to grow unchallenged, consumer trust in your brand will be maintained, and ecommerce revenues will be protected. Ultimately, by acting swiftly, brands will not have to wrestle with bad actors to regain control of the online space when restrictions are lifted.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Learn why Search Engines need to take action to protect consumers from counterfeit pharmaceuticals online.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.incoproip.com/how-search-engines-are-directing-consumers-to-dangerous-fake-pharmaceutical-products/">How search engines are directing consumers to dangerous fake pharmaceutical products</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.incoproip.com">INCOPRO</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>According to new Incopro research, up to 60% of the first-page results for the search query ‘buy Bactrim online’ (a branded antibiotic) are for sites selling counterfeit or unsafe products.</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pharma_6-in-10-search-results-unlawful_-positive_RGB_V2-1024x394.png" alt="" width="400" height="154" /></p>
<p>Fake pharmaceuticals are on the rise and are readily available online, with Search Engines pivotal in directing users to infringing locations. To uncover the scale of the issue, Incopro has undertaken new research into the role Search Engines play in serving counterfeit and other illegal content to unwitting consumers.</p>
<p>Search Engines are enabling illegal online pharmacies to flourish, and this puts consumers at great risk. Search engines should provide a scalable solution to help brands remove illegal online pharmacies from their index.</p>
<h2>The dangers of fake pharmaceuticals</h2>
<p>Consumers exposed to fake medications are put at severe risk. Counterfeits leave health issues untreated and may, in fact, make them worse by building pathogen resistance against an active ingredient found in the genuine drug. Consumers given the wrong dosages can also be susceptible to adverse side effects. In some cases, counterfeiters even add dangerous or toxic substances to their products to achieve a ‘desired’ side-effect to give them the aura of authenticity.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/One-third-of-medicines-are-fake_RGB.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>According to pharmaceutical company Bayer other examples of counterfeited drugs include[1]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products with manipulated expiration dates</li>
<li>Products containing no active agents (rendering the medicine useless)</li>
<li>­­Products wrapped in forged packaging</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding counterfeits through search</h3>
<p>Search Engines play a direct role in enabling illicit trade, with consumers fooled by the faux legitimacy given to locations found at the top of search queries. Alarmingly, consumers most often reach counterfeit locations through organic search queries, rather than direct links.</p>
<p>Incopro research reveals that, on average, over 58% of traffic for infringing pharmaceutical websites originates from organic search. Over 47% of traffic to these infringing locations comes from keywords that specify a brand or a particular product. This echoes a study by IFOP, a leading international polling and market research firm, that highlights that 47% of people who had bought an infringing product typed the name of the product into a Search Engine before making a purchase.</p>
<p>For pharmaceuticals, our research found that total traffic from product or brand keywords is 60%, indicating that consumers look for specific drugs when using search and are likely being unknowingly misdirected to infringing sites.</p>
<h4>Counterfeits appearing at the top of search results</h4>
<p>The problem is exacerbated by fraudulent websites appearing at the top of search results for popular queries. According to a 2017 study by one of the world’s largest telecommunications groups, Optify, the first result shown on a search query will receive over 44% of all “click-throughs”[2].</p>
<p>After an update to Google’s search algorithm in August 2018, dubbed ‘Medic’[3], commentators began suggesting that the platform may be inadvertently favoring fraudulent websites[4]. The update, while reportedly not aimed at the medical and health space, had the greatest impact on sites within this sector and, as with all previous core algorithm changes, was designed to “benefit pages that were previously under-rewarded”.</p>
<p>For the five sectors investigated in this study, more than 26% of potentially harmful sites appeared within the first three search results.</p>
<h4>Brand names and trademarks used within domains</h4>
<p>Those results appearing in the top spots were more likely to have a brand name in the domain name itself, indicating that search algorithms may, in fact, be favoring illicit locations that hijack trademarks for SEO.</p>
<p>Applying Incopro’s visibility score, our data-science-led method of indicating how visible an infringement is to consumers, we discovered that over 27% of potentially harmful websites had a visibility score of 10 or above, meaning that there was a high chance of being found by users. The analysis found that brand names and product-specific keywords were, again, prevalent in the domain names of these websites.</p>
<p>The screenshot below is the search results on Google.com for the term ‘buy Bactrim online’. Potentially harmful sites are highlighted in red, lawful sites in yellow, and “information only” websites in blue.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Screenshot taken on 07/05/2019: Search results on Google.com for the term ‘buy Bactrim online’ (Incopro, 2019)</em></p>
<p>60% of the results above were identified as potentially harmful. A “potentially harmful site” will typically use a third-party registered trademark without permission and fraudulently claim to be accredited by regulatory bodies[5].</p>
<p>By combining the highly conservative conversion rate of 2.5%[6] and the average traffic coming from organic search, we estimate that an infringing pharmaceutical site will sell to 642 users a month.</p>
<p>With this issue now reaching a critical state; we believe Search Engines can do more to stop it.</p>
<h3>An opportunity to protect consumers</h3>
<p>Google’s dominance is clear, holding 92.42% of the global market share today. But it is important to note that Search Engines such as Baidu, in China, and Yandex, in Russia, have a stronghold of their domestic markets (66.89% and 49.13% respectively).</p>

<p>The FDA and other government bodies have limited resources and cannot solve the issue alone. Brand owners should be able to seek remedies for themselves and alert platforms to infringement.</p>
<p>However, the issue needs to be approached at a sector level if it is to be effectively solved; online infringers are adept at switching tactics when one source of traffic and revenue is shut off.</p>
<p>By taking the lead, Search Engines can together set the standard for protecting consumers online.</p>
