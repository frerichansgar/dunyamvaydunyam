<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2021 posed unique challenges to brand protection teams, with online threats increasingly varied, supply chains disrupted, and department budgets tightening.</strong></p>



<p>Throughout this year however, members of the global brand protection community INSYNC remained resolute in their goal to protect consumers, with teams continually adapting to the fast-evolving online environment. Quotes and insights from the INSYNC community show teams responding to prolonged global uncertainty and shifts in online behavior by refocusing strategy, collaborating with internal teams, and building relationships with e-commerce platforms.</p>



<p>Read this blog to learn about the key developments within the industry in 2021, including emerging threats, new legislation, and innovative approaches to brand protection strategy.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Emerging threats in 2021</h2>



<p>The pandemic has continued to disrupt supply chains across the globe, meaning consumers have had difficulty in obtaining certain branded products. Counterfeiters and other bad actors have seized this opportunity to impersonate brands and defraud consumers.</p>



<h3 id="h-social-media-phishing-and-scams">Social media phishing and scams</h3>



<p>Brands in 2021 faced a growing tide of phishing scams and other types of fraud targeting their customers on social media.</p>



<p>Social media cybercrime generates a staggering&nbsp;<strong>$3.25</strong> billion&nbsp;for criminal networks annually[1]. <strong>61%</strong> of companies&nbsp;experience phishing attacks via their social media channels[2]. And as social media usage continues to increase, scammers have sought new methods to exploit brands and consumers.</p>



<p>Facebook and Instagram have emerged as popular platforms for fake ‘brand giveaways’, where scammers impersonate well-known brands advertising offering free product giveaways. Once consumers submit their personal information, the scammers use this to conduct identity and financial fraud.</p>



<p>In a sign of growing frustration from authorities, the&nbsp;head of enforcement at the FCA (UK) stated:</p>



<p><em>“Social media sites are effectively a gateway in which scammers are getting access to vast numbers of people in the population through online searches.”[3]</em></p>



<p>While platforms are taking steps to combat scammers, it is clear they can go further. Businesses too must adapt their brand protection strategies to safeguard consumers’ digital safety and trust on social media as threats continue to grow.</p>

<h3>COVID-related scams</h3>



<p>Brands and consumers contended with a barrage of COVID-related scams and fake products during 2021. These threats included:</p>



<h4>Listings for COVID vaccines on B2B &amp; B2C marketplaces</h4>



<p>Incopro’s experts have detected several unauthorized listings claiming to be ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Direct Suppliers’ on B2B platforms EC21, Ecplaza, and Tradekey. With the listings not directly referring to branded vaccines, identifying the key platforms sellers use to advertise these fake or unauthorized products plays a significant role in proactive enforcement.</p>



<p>COVID vaccine listings can often also be found on B2C platforms such as eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist. These usually involve sellers offering slots to get the vaccine. COVID vaccine manufacturers have confirmed to Incopro that the majority of these online offers are scams.</p>



<h4>Criminals selling COVID-related products</h4>



<p>Fake vaccine passports / certificates and even COVID test results are being sold on e-commerce websites and, increasingly, the dark web[4].</p>



<p>Law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) in the US are pursuing false COVID-related products and are notifying registrars when their services are used by bad actors. However, with over 1,000 COVID-related domains being registered per day, it’s clear that registrars and web hosts need to do more.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Legislation targeting platforms – EU</h2>



<p>On the legislative front 2021 heralded many promising changes, with increased pressure placed on e-commerce platforms and other online intermediaries.</p>



<p>In December 2020, The European Commission published its much-anticipated&nbsp;Digital Services Act package of measures<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;in what may amount potentially to the most sweeping reforms to tech regulation in Europe for more than two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two separate pieces of legislation (the&nbsp;Digital Services Act&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Digital Markets Act) appear to signify the arrival of root and branch reform to the Internet platform economy, assuming the draft texts are adopted by the European Parliament and are enacted into law.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The Digital Services Act (DSA)</h3>



<p>The DSA is designed to regulate the way in which platforms handle illegal or harmful content in their capacity as intermediaries which connect consumers with goods, services and content.</p>



<p>A central theme to the DSA is the notion that technology companies will need now to take much more responsibility for unlawful behavior on their platforms – and will face serious financial penalties if they do not.</p>



<p>While brand owners welcome the proposed legislation, there are several key improvements that are needed. Perhaps most critical of these are:</p>



<ul><li>Trusted Flaggers – ‘Trusted Flagger’ rules should apply to all hosting services and trusted flagger status should be available to all entities which demonstrate expertise and a high rate of accuracy when flagging content regardless of whether or not they are part of trade associations or collective bodies.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Repeat Infringers – The scope of this provision is too narrow; it needs to apply to all hosting services (e.g. cyberlockers). It should also permit the termination of the provision of services in egregious cases – for example in cases of repeated suspension.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/the-digital-services-act-what-do-brand-and-content-owners-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about DSA changes requested by brand owners &gt;</a></p>



<h3>The Digital Markets Act (DMA)</h3>



<p>In contrast to the DSA,&nbsp;the DMA&nbsp;applies to large online platforms which act as “Gatekeepers” in digital markets – acting as critical gateways for business users to reach end users (consumers). This includes search engines, intermediation services, social networking services, video-sharing platforms, operating systems, interpersonal communication services, cloud computing and advertising[6].</p>



<p>The DMA seeks to regulate these platforms to ensure that the markets in which they operate remain fair and competitive. The DMA imposes restrictions and obligations to ensure that Gatekeeper platforms behave in a fair way online.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Legislation targeting platforms – US</h2>



<p>Similar trends were observed in the US, with legislators increasing looking at the role of platforms and online intermediaries in facilitating the sale or access of infringing products and services.</p>



<h3>The Shop Safe Act</h3>



<p>The US Shop Safe Act Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 (The Lanham Act), with the addition of a section to make e-commerce platforms liable for trademark infringement and counterfeiting if they do not follow a number of best practices such as screening sellers and enforcing against repeat infringers.</p>



<h3>The INFORM Consumers Act</h3>



<p>The US INFORM Consumers Act (The Integrity, Notification, and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers), requires online marketplaces to collect, verify and disclose certain information from high-volume third-party sellers.</p>



<p>Following discussions in the senate, e-commerce platforms lobbied to define high-volume third-party sellers to include those that conduct 200 or more transactions resulting in total revenues of $7,000 or more during a continuous 12-month period.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/shop-safe-inform-consumers-act-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about US legislative developments &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Increased focus on repeat infringers</h2>



<p>In early 2021 Incopro released ‘Three Strikes and Out’, a white paper that explores how e-commerce platforms can tackle repeat infringers – an issue that brand owners are increasingly highlighting.</p>



<p>We found that <strong>23</strong> of the <strong>34</strong> e-commerce platforms considered have a policy directed at repeat infringers. The remaining <strong>11</strong> had no relevant policy evident. Out of the <strong>23</strong> e-commerce platforms that have a policy, only 3 had enacted a three-strikes rule.</p>



<p>We noted that platforms that do have a clear ‘three strikes’ rule and robust seller verification process – such as Aliexpress – see fewer repeat infringements than other platforms.</p>



<p>The white paper analyzed over 1.5m enforcements to help understand the scale of the issue, before setting out how brands, platforms and legislators can address the challenge to protect consumers, reduce losses suffered to counterfeiting and support rights holders.</p>



<p>Incopro’s analysis shows that:</p>



<ul><li>Only&nbsp;<strong>6%</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;sellers&nbsp;are&nbsp;repeatedly enforced on <strong>3 days</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>more</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>However, these sellers are responsible for over&nbsp;<strong>24%</strong>&nbsp;of the listings Incopro has enforced against&nbsp;</li><li>The models show that&nbsp;a seller verification and repeat infringer policy would significantly benefit consumers, brands, legislators, and the platforms themselves</li></ul>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Recognition of outcomes, not takedowns</h2>



<p><strong>“It’s important we’re not seen as ‘whack-a-mole’. It’s only whack-a-mole if you don’t apply data.”</strong></p>



<p><em>Gary Wengrofsky, Senior Director, Intellectual Property, Charter Communications speaking at the INSYNC Virtual Summit: November 2021</em></p>



<p>In 2021, the shift towards outcomes picked up pace. Many brand protection teams now set KPIs that focus on reducing the volume of infringement and cleaning up priority platforms, rather than the number of takedown notices sent.</p>



<p>With this approach, teams can free up resources for both targeted enforcement against high-risk infringements and to conduct in-depth data analysis and other value-adding activities. They can then deliver commercial value to the business and vastly increase return on investment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/brand-protection-kpis-how-to-focus-on-outcomes-not-takedowns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn how shifting the focus to outcomes delivers greater long-term value &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">A new brand protection maturity model</h2>



<p>With threats growing in both scale and variety, brand protection teams had a huge amount of ground to cover in 2021. From counterfeit goods and copycats, to fake NFTs and social media phishing scams, there are countless ways a company&#8217;s identity can be infringed and damaged online. The threats each business and industry faces vary, but there are general steps all organizations can take to evolve their approach.</p>



<p>As they mature, teams become an increasingly strategic asset — able not only to counter threats, but to identify new growth opportunities for the business.</p>



<p>In 2021, Incopro released an Online Brand Protection Maturity Report that outlines the four stages of this journey. From reactive teams that find themselves firefighting infringements, to effective teams that make use of advanced technology to tackle issues at scale, to progressive teams that champion wider applications of brand protection within their organizations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Was Willem Dafoe <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/yPdpjfB">a Spice Girl</a>? Did Nicholas Cage actually rescue the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/machine-learning-algorithm-ai-nicolas-cage-movies-indiana-jones/">Ark of the Covenant</a>? Two pressing questions we’re sure you’ll agree. Especially as they highlight the growth of ‘deepfaking’ in today’s society, which in turn can call into question the very nature of reality itself!</p>



<p>What is ‘deepfaking’? Well, the headline is that it involves the use of publicly available (and often free) software to swap faces in videos. No need for expensive Hollywood studios or <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/28/1007746/ai-deepfakes-memes/">deep programmer knowledge</a>, which means they’re now appearing everywhere – and further questioning our concept of ‘authenticity’.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-does-any-of-this-have-to-do-with-brand">What does any of this have to do with brand?</h2>



<p>Well, aside from the sheer joy of watching <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/l86qDWH">Mr Dafoe play Barack Obama or Michael Jackson</a>, it’s a topic that helps establish a point of view: that authenticity is fast becoming one of your company’s most valuable and fragile assets.</p>



<p>For example over half (59%) of 16-24s are more likely to buy fashion brands <a href="https://www.retail-focus.co.uk/generation-z-want-to-see-authenticity-in-their-fashion-brands-but-what-does-this-mean/">they consider authentic</a>.</p>



<p>Authenticity however is an asset that needs to be protected as much as it needs to be inspired. Today, brands live and grow in an open and connected world of online marketplaces, social media, and almost limitless choice. A place where everyone has a voice, making it feel at times like the Wild West!</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-from-doing-to-stopping">From doing to stopping</h2>



<p>When it comes to building authenticity, our instinct as marketers is to act, to create, and to communicate. That’s because we know from past experience that acting and behaving in the right way is key to building deep consumer trust. In fact, <a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/brand-related-112432">recent research highlights</a> that 59% of consumers are looking for brands that act responsibly.</p>



<p>Yet such activities have a significant limitation: they’re not addressing one of the core factors negatively impacting your brand’s authenticity: bad actors. These come in many shapes and sizes, but each has the potential to fake your brand, to serve up replica websites and products that severely compromise existing customer relationships – and cast doubt on your brand’s authenticity.</p>



<p>The fact is that today brands have a real responsibility to protect themselves and their customers. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/news/2-out-of-3-consumers-believe-that-brands-are-responsible-for-protecting-them-from-fake-products-and-misleading-marketing-content/">According to recent research conducted by Incopro</a>, 69% of consumers believe that brands have a responsibility to protect them from fake products or communications.</p>



<p>In fact, 56% of consumers said they would struggle to trust a brand after coming across fake products or communications from them. That’s why it’s important for marketers to add a fifth ‘P’ to their toolbox: Protection.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-minimizing-the-negative">Minimizing the negative</h2>



<p>Protecting a brand is no easy task, especially when you consider the channels and choices open to consumers. Take for example social media, which on the surface is the ideal platform for ‘getting authentic’ and being at your most open. The trouble here is that it also helps simplify the act of impersonation where anybody working under an assumed name, and backed up by freely available images, can slip into the shoes of even the world’s largest brands.</p>



<p>Not that they stop there. Once in place these bad actors can use your brand to attack people, or post views and opinions contrary to what your company stands for. And with the growth of ‘Instashopping’ (blended social media and ecommerce platforms) they can also run fake ads and direct your customers to fake websites in what amounts to a phishing exercise.</p>



<p>That’s why we believe that defending against such malicious activity should, in part at least, fall under the remit of marketing: because by offering such protection you’re also strengthening brand authenticity.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-building-up-your-defenses">Building up your defenses</h2>



<p>The task of identifying and taking down counterfeit products, fake sites, and illegitimate communications does of course sound like a problem for the legal department. Yet the reality today is that in the eyes of the consumer, one bad experience can compromise their entire relationship with a brand – even if you’re eventually proven to be innocent.</p>



<p>Shifting some of this responsibility over to marketing, along with the necessary tools and capabilities, also helps develop a solid platform for improving protection across 3 distinct levels:</p>



<ul><li>Protection from fake communications that can reduce or compromise your brand’s genuine voice</li><li>Removing the potential for fake products to damage a consumer’s perception of you</li><li>Enforcing your duty of care as a brand to help minimize the risk of fake and potentially dangerous products getting into a customer’s hands</li></ul>



<p>That alone should gain the attention of the brand-conscious marketer.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-summing-it-all-up">Summing it all up</h2>



<p>Authenticity isn’t something that’s created, rather it’s a brand treasure that requires careful protection. Doing that today however is as much about minimizing a consumer’s experience of the negative, as it is about promoting the positive. Particularly when trust and authenticity play such a key role in any purchase decision.</p>



<p>Combined, these factors help highlight the critical need for a fifth ‘P’ in marketing. Keeping it real matters – wouldn’t you agree Mr Dafoe?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Where else to start than with a quote from Jean-Paul Sartre: “If you seek authenticity for authenticity’s sake you are no longer authentic”.</p>



<p>A statement recently updated by <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8510725/billie-eilish-calvin-klein-mytruth-campaign">Billie Eilish for Calvin Klein’s #MyTruth</a> campaign, where she stated: “you can’t fake authenticity…” A sentiment that underpins CK’s aim to ‘embrace authentic self-expression’, with the goal of generating more authentic connections.</p>



<p>That’s a lot of authentic. Not that Calvin Klein are alone in seeking more meaningful, original, and genuine interactions with target audiences. The market is awash with stories promoting the importance of <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/10/10/why-marketers-must-look-within-create-authentic-brand-experiences">building trust and unleashing your ‘authentic voice’</a>. The question of course is how…</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Striving for trust and authenticity – 6 key ingredients</h2>



<p>As per Monsieur Sartre and Ms Eilish’s comments, authenticity and trust are qualities that are virtually impossible to fabricate. Instead, they emerge from the collective actions, passions, and purpose a company exhibits.</p>



<p>In other words, there’s an organic element to authenticity that defies efforts to control or coerce it. For brand owners, such a realization helps move the emphasis away from obsessively trying to ‘generate’ authenticity. Instead, efforts should be aimed at cultivating the behaviors and attributes needed to create experiences that lead to deeper and more trusting relationships.</p>



<p>Doing this however can be difficult, even in the best of circumstances when you control every customer touchpoint. It’s also a task that’s made more complex when you factor in the fakes, as well as those impersonators skillfully imitating your brand, your products, and your interactions with the outside world.</p>



<p>Staying authentic therefore requires consistent effort, and below we highlight the 6 key considerations to inspire your next steps:</p>



<h3 id="h-1-take-people-with-you">#1 Take people with you</h3>



<p>Showing the glitzy window dressing of your brand is one thing, but giving people access to you backstage elicits an entirely different response. Not that this should be surprising: consumers are after all buying into you as much as they’re buying your products, and they want to know what they&#8217;re getting in return. That’s why it’s important to give people the inside scoop, and to show them the ‘what’, ‘how’, and (most importantly) the ‘why’ driving your ambition. When they understand your motivations, they’re more willing to trust you.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-be-open-and-transparent">#2 Be open and transparent</h3>



<p>Few brands can openly claim to get <em>everything</em> right. For the rest, decisions and actions are taken with the honest intention of being better/smarter/cheaper etc. When mistakes do happen though, consumers have little patience for brands that attempt to ‘stage manage’ the fall out. Instead the emphasis needs to be on honesty, on holding your hands up, admitting your error, and detailing a fair response.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-keep-it-real">#3 Keep it real</h3>



<p>Authenticity can come in a variety of different forms, many of which emerge from the same fundamental source: the ability to be relatable. Yes, it’s important to offer the aspirational, but practical, pragmatic, and relevant are also valuable currencies – especially when they’re able to connect with and reflect the demands of real-life situations.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-stick-to-your-guns"><strong>#4 Stick to your guns</strong></h3>



<p>Brand values are some of the hardest qualities to impersonate. Counterfeiters can of course replicate your best sellers, but they can’t deliver them in the same inimitable way. Not if you remain consistent with what your brand stands for and offer a premium experience that helps to continually reinforce this credibility. Consistency mixed with a clear and relevant purpose makes for a powerful concoction.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-embrace-your-back-story">#5 Embrace your back story</h3>



<p>The myriad factors, personalities, and actions that shaped your company from origin to awesome are a true source of unique. Sharing this heritage through thoughtful and interesting stories helps generate substance, backing up your brand’s ‘right’ to adopt an exclusive position – while giving that authentic feel to everything you do.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-show-you-genuinely-care">#6 Show you genuinely care</h3>



<p>Many brands say they care about their customers, to the point that it’s almost become a stock ‘tick in the box’ statement. Consumers though can quickly tell the genuine from the spin, as they seek responsible and compassionate firms to build long-term relationships with. People expect high standards from their favourite brands, which in turn have a powerful responsibility to protect this trust from any bad actors or experiences.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Summing it all up…</h2>



<p>Authenticity and trust are delicate and intangible qualities to define. But they can, and have been by French philosophers, American singer songwriters, and consumers – based predominantly on their personal notions of what feels truly genuine.</p>



<p>What’s more, authenticity is becoming more important by the day, with <a href="https://www.retail-focus.co.uk/generation-z-want-to-see-authenticity-in-their-fashion-brands-but-what-does-this-mean/">Gen Z seeking it out in ever-greater numbers</a>. Why this is, is a question best left for the psychologists and social commentators, but to end (as we started) with a quote: “Hard times arouse an instinctive desire for authenticity”.</p>



<p>So said Coco Chanel who, if we didn’t know better, seemed to be coining a phrase with 2020 very much in mind.</p>
