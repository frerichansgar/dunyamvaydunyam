										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Was Willem Dafoe <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/yPdpjfB">a Spice Girl</a>? Did Nicholas Cage actually rescue the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/machine-learning-algorithm-ai-nicolas-cage-movies-indiana-jones/">Ark of the Covenant</a>? Two pressing questions we’re sure you’ll agree. Especially as they highlight the growth of ‘deepfaking’ in today’s society, which in turn can call into question the very nature of reality itself!</p>



<p>What is ‘deepfaking’? Well, the headline is that it involves the use of publicly available (and often free) software to swap faces in videos. No need for expensive Hollywood studios or <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/28/1007746/ai-deepfakes-memes/">deep programmer knowledge</a>, which means they’re now appearing everywhere – and further questioning our concept of ‘authenticity’.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-does-any-of-this-have-to-do-with-brand">What does any of this have to do with brand?</h2>



<p>Well, aside from the sheer joy of watching <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/l86qDWH">Mr Dafoe play Barack Obama or Michael Jackson</a>, it’s a topic that helps establish a point of view: that authenticity is fast becoming one of your company’s most valuable and fragile assets.</p>



<p>For example over half (59%) of 16-24s are more likely to buy fashion brands <a href="https://www.retail-focus.co.uk/generation-z-want-to-see-authenticity-in-their-fashion-brands-but-what-does-this-mean/">they consider authentic</a>.</p>



<p>Authenticity however is an asset that needs to be protected as much as it needs to be inspired. Today, brands live and grow in an open and connected world of online marketplaces, social media, and almost limitless choice. A place where everyone has a voice, making it feel at times like the Wild West!</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-from-doing-to-stopping">From doing to stopping</h2>



<p>When it comes to building authenticity, our instinct as marketers is to act, to create, and to communicate. That’s because we know from past experience that acting and behaving in the right way is key to building deep consumer trust. In fact, <a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/brand-related-112432">recent research highlights</a> that 59% of consumers are looking for brands that act responsibly.</p>



<p>Yet such activities have a significant limitation: they’re not addressing one of the core factors negatively impacting your brand’s authenticity: bad actors. These come in many shapes and sizes, but each has the potential to fake your brand, to serve up replica websites and products that severely compromise existing customer relationships – and cast doubt on your brand’s authenticity.</p>



<p>The fact is that today brands have a real responsibility to protect themselves and their customers. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/news/2-out-of-3-consumers-believe-that-brands-are-responsible-for-protecting-them-from-fake-products-and-misleading-marketing-content/">According to recent research conducted by Incopro</a>, 69% of consumers believe that brands have a responsibility to protect them from fake products or communications.</p>



<p>In fact, 56% of consumers said they would struggle to trust a brand after coming across fake products or communications from them. That’s why it’s important for marketers to add a fifth ‘P’ to their toolbox: Protection.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-minimizing-the-negative">Minimizing the negative</h2>



<p>Protecting a brand is no easy task, especially when you consider the channels and choices open to consumers. Take for example social media, which on the surface is the ideal platform for ‘getting authentic’ and being at your most open. The trouble here is that it also helps simplify the act of impersonation where anybody working under an assumed name, and backed up by freely available images, can slip into the shoes of even the world’s largest brands.</p>



<p>Not that they stop there. Once in place these bad actors can use your brand to attack people, or post views and opinions contrary to what your company stands for. And with the growth of ‘Instashopping’ (blended social media and ecommerce platforms) they can also run fake ads and direct your customers to fake websites in what amounts to a phishing exercise.</p>



<p>That’s why we believe that defending against such malicious activity should, in part at least, fall under the remit of marketing: because by offering such protection you’re also strengthening brand authenticity.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-building-up-your-defenses">Building up your defenses</h2>



<p>The task of identifying and taking down counterfeit products, fake sites, and illegitimate communications does of course sound like a problem for the legal department. Yet the reality today is that in the eyes of the consumer, one bad experience can compromise their entire relationship with a brand – even if you’re eventually proven to be innocent.</p>



<p>Shifting some of this responsibility over to marketing, along with the necessary tools and capabilities, also helps develop a solid platform for improving protection across 3 distinct levels:</p>



<ul><li>Protection from fake communications that can reduce or compromise your brand’s genuine voice</li><li>Removing the potential for fake products to damage a consumer’s perception of you</li><li>Enforcing your duty of care as a brand to help minimize the risk of fake and potentially dangerous products getting into a customer’s hands</li></ul>



<p>That alone should gain the attention of the brand-conscious marketer.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-summing-it-all-up">Summing it all up</h2>



<p>Authenticity isn’t something that’s created, rather it’s a brand treasure that requires careful protection. Doing that today however is as much about minimizing a consumer’s experience of the negative, as it is about promoting the positive. Particularly when trust and authenticity play such a key role in any purchase decision.</p>



<p>Combined, these factors help highlight the critical need for a fifth ‘P’ in marketing. Keeping it real matters – wouldn’t you agree Mr Dafoe?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Where else to start than with a quote from Jean-Paul Sartre: “If you seek authenticity for authenticity’s sake you are no longer authentic”.</p>



<p>A statement recently updated by <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8510725/billie-eilish-calvin-klein-mytruth-campaign">Billie Eilish for Calvin Klein’s #MyTruth</a> campaign, where she stated: “you can’t fake authenticity…” A sentiment that underpins CK’s aim to ‘embrace authentic self-expression’, with the goal of generating more authentic connections.</p>



<p>That’s a lot of authentic. Not that Calvin Klein are alone in seeking more meaningful, original, and genuine interactions with target audiences. The market is awash with stories promoting the importance of <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/10/10/why-marketers-must-look-within-create-authentic-brand-experiences">building trust and unleashing your ‘authentic voice’</a>. The question of course is how…</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Striving for trust and authenticity – 6 key ingredients</h2>



<p>As per Monsieur Sartre and Ms Eilish’s comments, authenticity and trust are qualities that are virtually impossible to fabricate. Instead, they emerge from the collective actions, passions, and purpose a company exhibits.</p>



<p>In other words, there’s an organic element to authenticity that defies efforts to control or coerce it. For brand owners, such a realization helps move the emphasis away from obsessively trying to ‘generate’ authenticity. Instead, efforts should be aimed at cultivating the behaviors and attributes needed to create experiences that lead to deeper and more trusting relationships.</p>



<p>Doing this however can be difficult, even in the best of circumstances when you control every customer touchpoint. It’s also a task that’s made more complex when you factor in the fakes, as well as those impersonators skillfully imitating your brand, your products, and your interactions with the outside world.</p>



<p>Staying authentic therefore requires consistent effort, and below we highlight the 6 key considerations to inspire your next steps:</p>



<h3 id="h-1-take-people-with-you">#1 Take people with you</h3>



<p>Showing the glitzy window dressing of your brand is one thing, but giving people access to you backstage elicits an entirely different response. Not that this should be surprising: consumers are after all buying into you as much as they’re buying your products, and they want to know what they&#8217;re getting in return. That’s why it’s important to give people the inside scoop, and to show them the ‘what’, ‘how’, and (most importantly) the ‘why’ driving your ambition. When they understand your motivations, they’re more willing to trust you.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-be-open-and-transparent">#2 Be open and transparent</h3>



<p>Few brands can openly claim to get <em>everything</em> right. For the rest, decisions and actions are taken with the honest intention of being better/smarter/cheaper etc. When mistakes do happen though, consumers have little patience for brands that attempt to ‘stage manage’ the fall out. Instead the emphasis needs to be on honesty, on holding your hands up, admitting your error, and detailing a fair response.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-keep-it-real">#3 Keep it real</h3>



<p>Authenticity can come in a variety of different forms, many of which emerge from the same fundamental source: the ability to be relatable. Yes, it’s important to offer the aspirational, but practical, pragmatic, and relevant are also valuable currencies – especially when they’re able to connect with and reflect the demands of real-life situations.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-stick-to-your-guns"><strong>#4 Stick to your guns</strong></h3>



<p>Brand values are some of the hardest qualities to impersonate. Counterfeiters can of course replicate your best sellers, but they can’t deliver them in the same inimitable way. Not if you remain consistent with what your brand stands for and offer a premium experience that helps to continually reinforce this credibility. Consistency mixed with a clear and relevant purpose makes for a powerful concoction.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-embrace-your-back-story">#5 Embrace your back story</h3>



<p>The myriad factors, personalities, and actions that shaped your company from origin to awesome are a true source of unique. Sharing this heritage through thoughtful and interesting stories helps generate substance, backing up your brand’s ‘right’ to adopt an exclusive position – while giving that authentic feel to everything you do.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-show-you-genuinely-care">#6 Show you genuinely care</h3>



<p>Many brands say they care about their customers, to the point that it’s almost become a stock ‘tick in the box’ statement. Consumers though can quickly tell the genuine from the spin, as they seek responsible and compassionate firms to build long-term relationships with. People expect high standards from their favourite brands, which in turn have a powerful responsibility to protect this trust from any bad actors or experiences.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Summing it all up…</h2>



<p>Authenticity and trust are delicate and intangible qualities to define. But they can, and have been by French philosophers, American singer songwriters, and consumers – based predominantly on their personal notions of what feels truly genuine.</p>



<p>What’s more, authenticity is becoming more important by the day, with <a href="https://www.retail-focus.co.uk/generation-z-want-to-see-authenticity-in-their-fashion-brands-but-what-does-this-mean/">Gen Z seeking it out in ever-greater numbers</a>. Why this is, is a question best left for the psychologists and social commentators, but to end (as we started) with a quote: “Hard times arouse an instinctive desire for authenticity”.</p>



<p>So said Coco Chanel who, if we didn’t know better, seemed to be coining a phrase with 2020 very much in mind.</p>
