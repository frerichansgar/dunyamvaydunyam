<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Protecting consumers and your reputation is critical to e-commerce success. A focused, deliberative strategy is needed to reduce infringement on key platforms and tackle large-scale criminal operators.</strong></p>



<p>We discuss how to prioritize and work with key platforms to reduce the volume of infringement. We then guide you through the tools at your disposal, allowing you to deliver against your Brand Protection goals.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-1-how-to-prioritize-platforms-to-review" style="color:#009ca6">Part 1: How to prioritize platforms to review</h2>



<p>It’s important to pick your battles and focus on&nbsp;threats that are&nbsp;most&nbsp;damaging to your brand&nbsp;and&nbsp;also&nbsp;where you are&nbsp;most&nbsp;likely to see ROI from your enforcement action.&nbsp;While Incopro discovers, prioritizes, and acts against infringements across platforms of all sizes, we find that over 80% of&nbsp;high-risk&nbsp;infringements occur&nbsp;on around 20 key platforms.</p>



<p>When&nbsp;determining your focus there are three key points to consider:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-1-protect-consumers-and-brand-value-eliminate-counterfeit-product-visible-to-potential-consumer">1. Protect consumers&nbsp;and brand value:&nbsp;eliminate counterfeit product visible to potential consumer&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Understand where your potential consumers shop.&nbsp;A good starting point is to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;key popular e-commerce platforms in each&nbsp;market&nbsp;and keep them clean from infringing product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep an eye on the emerging platforms: the way consumers shop online is constantly evolving.&nbsp;Social Commerce is not a new concept, but COVID-19 has really&nbsp;accelerated&nbsp;the process &#8211;&nbsp;2020 could be the year&nbsp;to watch as many&nbsp;social media&nbsp;platforms are&nbsp;investing in seamless&nbsp;commerce&nbsp;experiences.</p>



<h4 id="h-2-protect-your-own-e-commerce-channels-and-support-authorized-partners-eliminate-consumer-diversion-from-official-selling-channels">2. Protect your own e-commerce channels and support authorized partners: eliminate consumer diversion from official selling channels:&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong>Protect Official Websites:</strong>&nbsp;the majority of&nbsp;consumers are likely arriving at your website via organic or paid searches for your brand&nbsp;and products. Focus&nbsp;on first pages of Search Engines&nbsp;and&nbsp;Paid Search&nbsp;results;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Official Social Media Channels:</strong> audit social media platforms to eliminate impersonating pages and ads that cause consumer confusion;</p>



<p><strong>Official and authorised Marketplace stores:</strong> focus on marketplace platforms where your brands have their own stores. Focus on top pages of results, top selling products and categories, sponsored listings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a good place to engage your e-commerce and marketing teams&nbsp;that are likely to be the first ones to see the benefits of your enforcement efforts and be advocates of your brand protection program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-3-tackle-the-source-of-the-problem">3. Tackle the source of the&nbsp;problem:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Focus on the platforms in the regions known for manufacturing counterfeits.&nbsp;B2B&nbsp;platforms and wholesalers are often the source of the counterfeit product ending up on the consumer facing markets.</p>



<h4 id="h-take-a-strategic-approach-to-platform-enforcement">Take a strategic approach to platform enforcement</h4>



<p>Concentrating&nbsp;enforcement&nbsp;efforts on priority platforms and&nbsp;priority&nbsp;concerns will lead to&nbsp;better Brand Protection outcomes. The more you focus on a platform and knock-out infringement networks, the more effective your enforcement will be, allowing you to establish an effective deterrent against them coming back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is best to carve out specific goals around specific platforms, brands, products, IP, infringement types, etc. and to try to tackle the specific problem fully with the aim of sending a clear, credible message to counterfeiters.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>A comparison of strategic enforcement versus non-strategic enforcement on 5 example platforms:</strong></p>

<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-2-how-to-prioritize-infringements-found-on-different-platforms" style="color:#009ca6">Part 2: How to prioritize infringements found on different platforms&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once you’ve narrowed down the focus of your Brand Protection program, you&nbsp;need to&nbsp;consider the strategy that will allow you to&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;balance the&nbsp;two aspects:&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-1-reduce-visibility-of-counterfeit-products-b2c">1. Reduce&nbsp;visibility of counterfeit products&nbsp;(B2C):&nbsp;</h4>



<ul><li>Infringing offers on first pages of results that divert attention from genuine product&nbsp;</li><li>Sponsored&nbsp;ads and&nbsp;listings&nbsp;as these are more likely to confuse the consumer&nbsp;</li><li>Good metrics:&nbsp;Some marketplaces platforms (e.g. eBay, AliExpress) share information on the number of transactions made on a listing. The offers with highest sales transactions are more likely to be visible to consumer.&nbsp;</li><li>Users and Sellers with high number of&nbsp;Likes, Favourites, and Followers&nbsp;have large audience and are more damaging&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-2-remove-large-scale-infringers-b2c-and-b2b">2. Remove&nbsp;large scale infringers&nbsp;(B2C and&nbsp;B2B):</h4>



<ul><li>Sellers with large volume of&nbsp;stock&nbsp;</li><li>Sellers with&nbsp;large&nbsp;numbers&nbsp;of&nbsp;infringing&nbsp;listings&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Sellers operating via multiple channels&nbsp;</li><li>Re-offenders</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-3-tips-for-working-with-the-e-commerce-giants-amazon-ebay-alibaba-facebook" style="color:#009ca6">Part 3:&nbsp;Tips for working with the e-commerce giants – Amazon, eBay, Alibaba &amp;&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;</h2>



<p>You need to work with the e-commerce and social media giants, plus other platforms, to get results.&nbsp;Most&nbsp;global&nbsp;platforms already have&nbsp;established processes and&nbsp;IP reporting tools available:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Amazon: Online Portal and Brand Registry&nbsp;together with other piloted projects like Amazon Project Zero&nbsp;</li><li>eBay:&nbsp;VeRO&nbsp;program&nbsp;</li><li>Alibaba IPP&nbsp;platform&nbsp;</li><li>Facebook&nbsp;has the webforms&nbsp;and Commerce and Ads IP tool&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>These tools allow brand owners and their agents to report such IP infringements&nbsp;as&nbsp;counterfeits and misuse of trademarks and copyright imagery. With time we see these tools evolve to address new infringer behavior with pressure from the brand owners.</p>



<p>Examples of this include the Facebook Commerce&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ads&nbsp;IP tool that identifies infringing ads on Facebook and Instagram and changes to the Amazon Brand Registry to address&nbsp;broader marketplace&nbsp;policy violations and introduce AI features to assist with proactive monitoring.</p>



<h4 id="h-platform-limitations">Platform limitations</h4>



<p>Unfortunately, these&nbsp;tools are not fully caught up to provide a&nbsp;robust&nbsp;response mechanism to emerging threats.</p>



<p>While the Amazon BR and Alibaba IPP tools are useful when it comes to sending out enforcements and getting items actioned quickly, they&nbsp;are not&nbsp;enough&nbsp;on their own because they do not provide robust capabilities for:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Collecting comprehensive data and getting&nbsp;visibility on the scale and types of problems on a platform.&nbsp;</li><li>Prioritization&#8211;organizing&nbsp;and grouping infringements for efficient&nbsp;enforcement;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Identifying infringement networks and recurring activity; and&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Maintaining records&nbsp;of the items that have been actioned&nbsp;and&nbsp;reporting.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Talisman, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Incopro’s Brand Protection platform</a>,&nbsp;is a complementary tool that ensures that brands have all the data they need related to infringements and a way to easily export material for efficient enforcement using the platform tools.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-4-how-to-address-new-threats-from-emerging-platforms" style="color:#009ca6">Part 4:&nbsp;How to address new threats from emerging platforms&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Social commerce is capturing demand for seamless consumer interactions, particularly from millennials and generation Z. Social media&nbsp;platforms are&nbsp;fast transforming from serving as a social marketing&nbsp;tool&nbsp;to&nbsp;e-commerce with users never having to leave the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The primary players in social commerce are Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook and now also&nbsp;TikTok.&nbsp;TikTok, for example,&nbsp;has started to allow some users to add links to e-commerce sites to their profile biography as well as the ability to easily send their viewers to shopping websites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumers are also being pushed to other platforms, including standalone e-commerce shops, such as Shopify which are easy to set up and maintain.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-strong-platform-relationships-are-essential">Strong platform relationships are essential</h4>



<p>Many platforms claim they are not in a position to police themselves, both in terms of labor and technology capabilities, and the burden is still on IP owners to report&nbsp;the infringements.&nbsp;Maintaining strong relationships with both established and emerging platforms is therefore critical to successfully reducing infringement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brands should engage with platforms regularly and have direct contact with their&nbsp;team to understand how they work, and&nbsp;to be able to provide feedback on what works well and what can improve. Compliance and platform response times improve when you take the time to educate the platform about your brands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see that infringers behavior is&nbsp;constantly&nbsp;evolving and&nbsp;they adopt to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;detection and&nbsp;enforcement.&nbsp;The ability to alert and advise platforms on these trends is essential to keeping up with bad actors.</p>



<p>When engaging emerging platforms, we suggest taking the following approach as part of your relationship building exercise:</p>



<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts: support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;</li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;</li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h2>



<ul type="1"><li><strong>Consider which&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;to&nbsp;tackle&nbsp;first based on where your consumers are, the volume of issues, your commercial objectives&nbsp;and how much impact you need to make to reduce your problem.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Engage with the platforms in a positive way, embrace their tools and&nbsp;give them&nbsp;feedback&nbsp;about&nbsp;where you would like to see them improve.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Keep an eye on the new and emerging platforms&nbsp;in case you need to add those to your top&nbsp;platform list.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>With the huge challenges facing all businesses as the world rapidly moves to online retail, consumer trust in digital channels is critical. There has never been a more important time to revisit how you approach protecting your brand and consumers on e-commerce platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Counterfeiters and other online bad actors are opportunistic at their core and will seize on any chance to make a quick profit out of unsuspecting consumers. The COVID-19 crisis is no different, with bad actors swift to list both medical products and everyday consumer items at marked-up prices as demand skyrockets.</strong></p>



<p>Price gouging refers to the act of exploiting consumers during an external crisis by charging excessive prices for products far above the market rate. During the COVID-19 crisis, price gouging has been observed on B2C marketplaces and websites by distributors and private sellers. Many countries have anti-price gouging legislation to protect consumers during national emergencies, but even where protections do not exist platforms will often prohibit the practice.</p>



<p>In April, Amazon claimed it had removed more than half a million COVID-related items and suspended more than 6,000 sellers across its global marketplaces after infringing its price gouging rules[1].</p>



<p>In an unusual step, Amazon has even gone as far as requesting new legislation to be drafted with VP of Public Policy Brian Huseman calling on Congress to make price gouging illegal during a national crisis[2]. The executive notes that similar laws already exist at state level and are effective at fighting bad actors online.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 crisis has seen a dramatic increase in price gouging on a wide range of products, including those that consumers are more reliant on than ever: pharmaceuticals, hygiene products, and medical equipment. This piece looks at the data, providing analysis of the scale of the issue, before sharing insights into how your business can tackle this growing threat effectively.</p>



<h3>Price gouging pharmaceuticals: Exploiting vulnerable consumers</h3>



<p>COVID-19 related price gouging was first identified on marketplace listings for pharmaceuticals and other medical equipment supplies. Globally, enforcement agencies and regional authorities are looking to demonstrate their vigilance to the public in this climate and are watching for price hikes.</p>

<p>Talisman, Incopro’s Brand Protection platform, has identified rampant price gouging in recent weeks &#8211; which were then acted on by our analysts. These are just two of the countless infringing listings discovered:</p>



<ul><li>Price gouging of up to a staggering <strong>750%</strong> for a well-known painkiller with a box of 24 capsules on eBay for <strong>$329</strong> with no guarantee they are authentic.</li><li>Price gouging of up to <strong>100%</strong> for a global cold &amp; flu brand across key marketplaces around the world.</li></ul>



<p>Price gougers are exploiting vulnerable consumers who feel that they have little choice but to pay the hugely inflated prices for essential medical drugs and supplies.</p>



<h3><strong>Price gouging on consumer goods: Taking advantage of spikes in demand</strong></h3>



<p>The issue is not isolated to the health sector; we have also observed an increase in price gouging across a wide range of other product categories. Incopro’s Brand Protection experts harnessed Talisman to monitor these product categories on Amazon US for price gouging:</p>



<h4>Desks and computer monitors</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>desks</strong> and <strong>computer monitors</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings on average by <strong>193%</strong> since COIVD-19 hit. An example can be seen below, showing the increase in price listed by a third-party seller for a desk from the beginning of the year to now, clearly taking advantage of the crisis.</p>



<p>One listing for a simple home-working desk saw a large price increase of <strong>247%</strong>, going from <strong>$89</strong> to <strong>$220</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1000" height="476" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020.jpg" alt="Price fluctuations on home office furniture sold on Amazon.com (May 2020)" class="wp-image-8072" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020.jpg 1000w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption>Price fluctuations on home office furniture sold on Amazon.com (May 2020)</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Sports and exercise equipment</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>bench presses</strong> and <strong>yoga mats</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings by <strong>168%</strong> on average since COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>One listing saw a large price increase of <strong>370%</strong>, going from <strong>$160</strong> to <strong>$330</strong>. This screenshot of a customer review from March 2020 shows that the product listed was cheap and potentially harmful, yet concedes that there’s ‘slim pickings’ due to the pandemic’s effect on supply:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1378" height="345" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020.png" alt="Amazon customer review for bench press (March 2020)" class="wp-image-8074" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020.png 1378w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-300x75.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-1024x256.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-768x192.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1378px) 100vw, 1378px" /><figcaption>Amazon customer review for bench press (March 2020)</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Home entertainment</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>a leading games console</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings by <strong>161%</strong> since COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>This data shows that sellers are taking advantage of COVID-19 to increase the prices of their listings, with all categories showing sellers increasing their prices by over <strong>150%</strong> since the crisis has hit.</p>



<h3>The threat to consumer safety and brand reputation</h3>



<p>Not only do consumers face the prospect of massively overpaying for a product, there is also a chance that the products they are purchasing are already used[3] – meaning consumers are not getting what they paid for, or even non-genuine – putting consumers at risk of physical harm.</p>



<p>Brands face a two-fold issue with price gouging:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Policing distributors that are selling genuine product far above the market rate/agreed price</li><li>Removing copycat/counterfeit products that use the brand’s IP and are sold far above the market rate</li></ol>



<p>Price gouging damages brand reputation and consumer trust in a brand, regardless if the product on offer is genuine. Distributors of the products will not face the brunt of your reputational damage, even if they are the party engaging in price gouging. Any damage is likely to be long-term and extremely difficult to repair.</p>



<p>In April, Incopro polled 87 business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, asking about what they perceived to be the biggest risk to their businesses due to COVID-19 – over&nbsp;<strong>45%</strong>&nbsp;said the risk to consumer trust and the consumer-to-brand relationship. This highlights that they recognize the risk that the shift in market dynamic has created.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Platforms cannot tackle the threat alone</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve noted that some platforms are taking action, and governments are setting up dedicated &#8216;price gouging&#8217; taskforces &#8211; but they are unable to stem the tide alone. Amazon, for example, will actively monitor for price gouging, but due to the scale of the problem and the limits of their technology may be slow to identity and remove infringements. However, if they are notified by a brand of specific instances of price gouging, they will be able to act far swifter.</p>



<p>Incopro’s Brand Protection technology and expert analysts give you cross-platform, cross-territory insights into price gouging with a tried and tested online enforcement solution delivered at scale directly from the platform. The platform can also collate evidence packs for injunctions and wider monetary relief. and bespoke reporting by brand, platform, territory provides internal stakeholders with valuable sales insights.</p>



<p>Price gouging is not a new phenomenon – it existed before COVID-19 and will continue even as the global crisis eventually subsides. By taking a strong stance now, you can put consumer safety at the heart of your Brand Protection strategy.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Bad actors are exploiting the COVID-19 crisis by infiltrating the digital channels consumers now rely on. Learn how Brand Protection can provide maximum value – protecting consumers and brands – with a strategic, refocused approach.</strong></p>



<p>Consumer behavior is evolving rapidly, and we should anticipate an enduring shift of purchasing habits online. The increased time spent across all digital channels exposes consumers to increased risks – a level of risk that they would not be facing when visiting physical retail stores.</p>



<h3>Fast heading towards a new normal</h3>



<p>The ‘new normal’, a phrase that is fast entering common parlance, is being used to describe social distancing measures and other behaviors that will likely be necessary for an extended period. But this phrase also applies to consumer buying habits and the future of e-commerce, with the pandemic likely to have a profound, permanent impact on where consumers decide to purchase the brands that they love.</p>



<p>While tourism has seen a huge slump, the majority of sectors have seen online sales growth as displayed below. Consumers still require the vast majority of products that they purchased pre-COVID-19 – they are just pivoting to new channels to acquire them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="998" height="406" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19.png" alt="Heading towards the New Normal - Online sales growth during COVID-19" class="wp-image-7705" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19.png 998w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19-300x122.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heading-towards-the-New-Normal-Online-sales-growth-during-COVID-19-768x312.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px" /></figure>



<p>The shift online will not replace offline spend across all sectors but represents a material change in consumers’ expectations of brands. We would have expected e-commerce as a share of retail in the US to drop after the usual Q4 peak, but as seen in the graph below it has continued to grow after the Q4 2019 peak through Q1 2020.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="560" height="410" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ecommerce-as-a-share-of-retail-2015-2019.png" alt="Ecommerce as a share of retail 2015-2019" class="wp-image-7706" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ecommerce-as-a-share-of-retail-2015-2019.png 560w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ecommerce-as-a-share-of-retail-2015-2019-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></figure>



<p style="color:#009ca6;font-size:18px" class="has-text-color"><strong>“It’s very likely that these behaviors will continue, even when the coronavirus pandemic eventually subsides. Why? Because ecommerce habits tend to form during periods of intense activity, and those habits already have momentum, they come even stickier.”</strong></p>



<p> &#8211; Andrew Lipsman, eMarketer</p>



<h3>Bad actors have reacted swiftly to the COVID-19 crisis</h3>



<p>Counterfeiters and other bad actors are agile operators, reacting to the crisis by creating new products to meet increased demand, often as lookalike brands rather than direct counterfeits to avoid detection.</p>



<p>Talisman, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Incopro’s Brand Protection platform</a>, discovered 20,000 units of counterfeit sanitizer sold on 1 Alibaba listing in a month, almost all sold to the US.</p>



<p>Brands otherwise unrelated to COVID-19 and hygiene are equally targeted by bad actors intending to capitalize on increased demand for hygiene goods, such as these fake face masks seen below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1014" height="400" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7711" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon.png 1014w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon-300x118.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fake-face-masks-discovered-on-Amazon-768x303.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px" /><figcaption>Fake &#8216;branded&#8217; face masks seen on Amazon.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bad actors have also increased supply of genuine critical medicines in line with news events and are selling at vastly inflated prices; supply has increased as the lockdown has endured. Incopro has monitored high-risk listings in the US for a painkiller brand between February and April. See the below graph that illustrates this disturbing trend in the US and maps it against key milestones during the crisis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="759" height="376" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/High-risk-detections-in-USA-for-painkiller-brand.png" alt="High risk detections in USA for painkiller brand" class="wp-image-7720" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/High-risk-detections-in-USA-for-painkiller-brand.png 759w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/High-risk-detections-in-USA-for-painkiller-brand-300x149.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /></figure>



<p>Price gouging has been rampant throughout the crisis, with standard packs of painkillers such as the brand monitored above sold for up to US$999.</p>



<p>As expected, bad actors have adapted their behavior to avoid traditional detection techniques in the way they list products and the way they utilize digital channels. Businesses need to keep up if they are to protect their consumers and digital revenues.</p>



<h3>All types of online brand abuse are on the rise</h3>



<p>Brands are seeing ‘traditional’ types of online brand abuse increase, regardless of whether the product’s design or description can be linked to COVID-19.</p>



<p>Listings for non-genuine goods have increased for a wide range of products unrelated to hygiene as counterfeiters look to capitalize on increased online shopping. Since December 2019, for example, Incopro’s Talisman software has detected:</p>



<ul><li>A 94%&nbsp;increase in non-genuine listings of home appliance products &amp; spare parts since December 2019</li><li>A 51%&nbsp;increase in non-genuine listings of sporting goods and running shoes since December 2019</li><li>A 45%&nbsp;increase in non-genuine listings of high-end, luxury shoes since December 2019</li></ul>



<h3>Consumer trust is under threat in the long term</h3>



<p>On April 29, Incopro polled 87 business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, asking about what they perceived to be the biggest risk to their businesses due to COVID-19 &#8211; over <strong>45%</strong> said the risk to consumer trust and the consumer to brand relationship. This highlights that they are recognizing the risk that the shift in market dynamic has created.</p>



<p> Criminal activity that damages consumer trust online, such as phishing schemes and financial scams, is now being seen as a critical issue facing businesses. We are seeing businesses that would not traditionally face high volumes of online scams using their brand and IP now entering the crosshairs of online criminals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="864" height="148" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7700" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams.png 864w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams-300x51.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Threat-to-trust-Online-scams-768x132.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /><figcaption>Data sourced from Google’s ‘Transparency Report’ tool and a report released by Barclays in April 2020.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Take Morrisons, a leading UK grocery store, for example. During the initial stockpiling period of the crisis, Incopro analysts discovered a phishing scheme targeting Morrisons’ customers that posed as an online competition to win unlimited groceries. The linked website asked consumers to enter their personal details and was connected to multiple social media pages and accounts, including a Facebook page. The latter accrued over&nbsp;<strong>5.9k</strong>&nbsp;followers before it was eventually removed by the platform.</p>



<p>Counterfeiters have responded rapidly to increased demand for many categories and will react to future changes in consumer behavior. There has been a significant increase in all forms of brand abuse that threaten consumers’ trust in brands – <a>businesses need to </a>maintain the valuable relationships they have built through omnichannel touchpoints over a long period of time.</p>



<h3>Build the internal case for Brand Protection</h3>



<p>Those responsible for protecting consumers should take focus on <strong>three key actions</strong> that will support awareness and effectiveness in the current climate and beyond.</p>



<ul type="1"><li><strong>Build internal coalition</strong></li></ul>



<p>Build working groups including ecommerce, marketing &amp; security across function and ensure all relevant parties are engaged &amp; aligned</p>



<ul><li><strong>Communicate to senior leadership</strong></li></ul>



<p>Proactively report value &amp; risks to senior leadership around business outcomes: customer safety, revenue &amp; trust</p>



<ul><li><strong>Articulate the full business value of brand protection</strong></li></ul>



<p>Where budgets are under pressure or increased investment is needed, it is critical that the full value of brand protection is understood.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Strategic initiatives for your Brand Protection program</h2>



<p>With the huge challenges facing all businesses &#8211; bricks &amp; mortar retail channels shutting down, workforces operating remotely, and the furloughing of staff – consumer trust in digital channels is critical to survival. There has never been a more important time to protect your brand and consumers online.</p>



<p>In the same poll of business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, we asked whether their business had altered strategy in the face of changing consumer behavior – over <strong>85%</strong> said&nbsp;they had already made changes or were planning to, and only <strong>1%</strong> stated they did not plan to make any changes.</p>



<p>The blueprint for Brand Protection success will vary by business and sector, but there are five key levers for actions you should be taking:</p>



<p style="color:#009ca6" class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. Align with key sales channels to capture online revenue</strong></p>



<p>Align Brand Protection strategies with ecommerce to focus on key products, territories &amp; platforms</p>



<p style="color:#009ca6" class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. Prioritize in line with consumer behavior to protect trust</strong></p>



<p>Focus enforcement on what the consumer sees &amp; buys – prioritize to listing spots &amp; owning key social channels</p>



<p style="color:#009ca6" class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Re-allocate resources from offline to online</strong></p>



<p>Leverage offline budgets to increase online focus. If not possible, consider pooling budgets with other functions</p>



<p style="color:#009ca6" class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. Ensure that COVID-19 related threats are addressed as critical business issues</strong></p>



<p>Reputational risk is significant &amp; these issues should be flagged to senior leadership and mitigated rapidly</p>



<p style="color:#009ca6" class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. Review monitoring approach to address evolving infringer behavior</strong></p>



<p>Ensure your solution captures threats such as lookalikes and techniques such as hiding text in images</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:22px"><strong>The COVID-19 crisis has revealed the best and the worst in humanity. Heroic efforts by healthcare workers have been seen across the globe. However, these efforts are being constantly undermined by bad actors looking to exploit huge spikes in demand for products such as hand sanitizer and face masks.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us/">Independent market research commissioned by Incopro</a> found that 34% of US consumers believe fake pharmaceutical products pose the greatest threat to consumers today versus other ‘fake’ goods and information available online (sample included: social media accounts, reviews, news, and several product categories).</p>



<p>At a time where consumers are less likely to be cautious when purchasing these types of products, the danger could not be more real. News continues to pour in of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52288675" target="_blank">fake personal COVID-19 testing kits</a> being intercepted throughout the world. Whereas authorities in China have continued to battle counterfeit face masks, having <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-china-confiscated-over-31-million-counterfeit-face-masks-report-2020-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confiscated over 31 million fake masks at the end of February</a>.</p>



<p>Incopro research finds that<strong> 83%</strong> of US consumers look for warning signs when shopping online.&nbsp;However, while they claim to compare prices with going market rates (<strong>31%</strong>), consider the legitimacy of a website (<strong>25%</strong>), read customer reviews (<strong>45%</strong>), and look at the country of the product/seller (<strong>32%</strong>), the COVID-19 crisis has thrown buyer caution to the wind. Consumers are more likely to purchase first and think later as they compete with others for scarce goods and products that now hold increased perceived value such as face masks and hand sanitizer.</p>



<h3>The ecommerce boom</h3>



<p>With a large percentage of the US population now working from home and social distancing measures in place, there will be a tectonic move towards e-commerce. Online shopping trends observed during holidays suggests that change in behavior may be part of a step-change and may become the new normal even after the crisis eventually subsides.</p>



<p>Online shopping is increasing across all countries. However increases have been seen most where lockdown measures have been tightest (for the longest period of time) – <strong>18%</strong> of UK consumers &amp; <strong>23%</strong> of US consumers said they had increased online shopping to date for things they previously bought in shops, vs. <strong>31%</strong> in Italy and <strong>50%</strong> in China, according to a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-03/tracking-the-coronavirus-wave4-ipsos.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ipsos Mori survey conducted in March</a>. We can expect more European countries and the US to increase online shopping as they get used to lockdown procedures and the more prolonged social distancing measures.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/how-ecommerce-platforms-facilitate-online-counterfeiting/">Online marketplaces have become a hotbed for&nbsp;counterfeit sellers</a>, steering customers to their own products by undercutting the prices of the legitimate items. Over the last couple of years, both government and online marketplaces in China have adopted a tougher stance against counterfeiters and other types of brand abuse. As a result, many of the bad actors operating out of China that once frequented platforms such as Taobao and AliExpress have now moved their operations to western marketplaces such as Amazon who have taken a less aggressive approach.</p>



<h3>FAKE FACE MASKS</h3>



<p>As countries begin to shift their COVID-19 guidance and recommend that the general public wear face masks to slow the transmission of the virus, it is critical that the products being touted are genuine and certified for use.</p>



<p>According to Ipsos Mori, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en/more-people-say-theyre-wearing-masks-protect-themselves-covid-19-march" target="_blank"><strong>50%</strong> of US consumers now say they wear face masks to protect themselves</a> (survey conducted April 9-12) &nbsp;– an increase of <strong>38 </strong>percentage points versus last month (March 12-14).</p>



<p>In the first week of March <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Talisman</a>, Incopro&#8217;s Brand Protection platform, discovered over <strong>1,150</strong> social media posts on four key platforms (Facebook,<br>Twitter, Instagram, and Vkontakte) selling counterfeit respiratory masks – a 2,490% increase as compared to the minimal levels of similar posts in December 2019 before the pandemic.</p>



<p>Exploiting concerned members of the public, these untested, poor-quality face masks are highly unlikely to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="988" height="879" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Illegimate-facemasks_Source-NIOSH.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7377" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Illegimate-facemasks_Source-NIOSH.jpg 988w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Illegimate-facemasks_Source-NIOSH-300x267.jpg 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Illegimate-facemasks_Source-NIOSH-768x683.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /><figcaption>Source: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong>UNREGULATED HAND SANITIZERS</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Talisman</a> identified a <strong>270%</strong> increase in listings of non-genuine hygiene products such as hand sanitizers and anti-bacterial wipes in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019.</p>



<p>These products were untested, unregulated, and likely to be ineffective. Many of these listings contained false claims about being able to kill the coronavirus or protection against contracting the disease. </p>



<p>Furthermore, there has been an explosion in lookalike brands ripping off established brands health-related products, and unregulated sellers selling medicines at inflated prices that is unlikely to be genuine product.</p>



<p>With prices of products such as hand sanitizer increasing by the day as supply of verified brands struggle to keep up with demand, inflated prices of unknown and newly listed products are indicators that the goods may be illegitimate.</p>



<p>Hand sanitizers are drugs as defined by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration and are therefore subject to stringent regulations. It is highly likely that the non-branded products being listed on marketplaces do not adhere to these regulations and therefore put consumers at risk.</p>



<h3><strong>SPIKES IN ILLEGITIMATE GOODS: NON-HYGIENE PRODUCTS</strong></h3>



<p>Listings for non-genuine goods have increased for a range of products apparently unrelated to COVID-19 as counterfeiters look to capitalize on increased online shopping. Since December 2019, for example, Incopro’s Talisman software has detected:</p>



<ul><li><strong>94%</strong> increase in non-genuine listings of home appliance products &amp; spare parts since December 2019</li><li><strong>51% </strong>increase in non-genuine listings of sporting goods and running shoes since December 2019</li><li><strong>45%</strong> increase in non-genuine listings of high-end, luxury shoes since December 2019</li></ul>



<p>As the public adjusts to the ‘New Normal’ that <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/uk/en/insights/article/2020/covid-19-tracking-the-impact-on-fmcg-and-retail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nielsen forecasts</a> with increased levels of online consumption, it’s likely that more than the <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us/"><strong>26% </strong>of consumers who mistakenly bought a counterfeit online last year</a> will be deceived by bad actors in the future.</p>



<h3>PHISHING SCHEMES AND FAKE ADVERTISEMENTS</h3>



<p>Phishing schemes and fake news are also key issues facing brands during the pandemic.</p>



<p>While phishing sites often contain grammatical or spelling errors within the product information, many consumers still fall victim to these online scams. Often, bad actors deceive buyers by changing the spelling of a well-known brand or shop and including it in the website address. With the majority of bricks &amp; mortar stores forced to close temporarily, consumers will be looking for the brands&#8217; digital presence and will be highly susceptible to false association and scams.</p>



<p>In March, Incopro analysts discovered a phishing website that exploited the initial panic-buying that swept across the country by offering ‘unlimited’ groceries from Morrisons, a leading UK supermarket, to winners of an online competition. This website had multiple social media pages and accounts, including a Facebook page with that accrued over <strong>5.9k</strong> followers. This highlights how well-intentioned consumers are often duped by these criminal schemes.</p>



<h3>Consumers cannot be exposed to illegitimate products</h3>



<p>The sheer volume of illegitimate goods highlights the challenge facing brands and consumers during this global health crisis. It also displays the alarming ease in which can infiltrate the digital channels consumers rely on.</p>



<p>Consumers are unlikely to be aware of the full scale of the threat posed by counterfeits and other illegitimate goods online. And they should not be expected to take responsibility for weeding out the fakes from the real. Combatting counterfeits requires a concerted, joint effort from government and global health authorities, brands, and platforms.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Brand protection is more important than ever</h2>

<p class="has-medium-font-size" id="h-counterfeits-are-on-the-rise-on-social-media-and-this-is-having-a-direct-impact-on-brand-reputation-and-image"><strong>Counterfeits are on the rise on social media, and this is having a direct impact on brand reputation and image. </strong></p>



<p><strong>8%</strong> of US consumers buy fake designer brands to look good and 5% lie to promote luxury products or a brand, according to <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us/">new Incopro research</a>.</p>



<p>This intentional misrepresentation has a
hugely damaging impact and underlines the challenges facing brands in retaining
control over consumer perception and the quality of their digital experience.</p>



<p>Counterfeiting and other infringement on social
media is a huge problem that brands cannot afford to ignore.</p>



<h3>Research reveals social media infringement is rife</h3>



<p>Over a quarter <strong>(26%)</strong> of US consumers have been fooled into buying fake goods over the past 12 months, and this is fueled by the volume of fakes on social media platforms. <strong>56,769 </strong>active accounts promoting counterfeits were discovered on Instagram in 2019 – an increase of more than 171% compared to three years prior (20,892 counterfeit accounts) [1].</p>



<p>A quick search on Instagram or Facebook for high-end luxury goods brings up hundreds of posts advertising fake products for sale. Equally, counterfeit cosmetics are rife, putting consumers in direct contact with harmful ingredients. </p>



<p>With <strong>45%</strong> of the world’s population now active social media users (The Next Web 2019), online counterfeiting poses a greater risk than ever to consumers and brands.</p>



<h3>Social media influencers found promoting counterfeits</h3>



<p>5% of US consumers admit to paying for fake
followers on social media (a tactic deployed by some budding influencers), highlighting
that misrepresentation is a widespread issue online.</p>



<p>A number of prominent influencers have previously been found to be promoting counterfeit products. Either turning a blind eye or remaining unaware of the true nature of the products, these high-profile social media users have peddled fake goods to millions of their loyal followers.</p>



<p>In 2018, influencers Emma Cakecup and Oltean Vlad were revealed to be promoting websites that offered counterfeit products such as watches[2] to a combined follower base of over 1 million consumers.</p>



<p>While there have been several cases involving
influencers knowingly promoting counterfeit goods, there are many online
personalities that simply do not verify products, possibly leading to the sale of
dangerous counterfeit goods from ecommerce sites.</p>



<p>In a 2019 BBC investigation[3], three well-known influencers were asked to promote a fake diet drink that contained cyanide, a highly toxic chemical. The trio agreed despite not trying the drink or understanding the dangers posed by the ingredients within.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
<h3>The emergence of social buying platforms</h3>



<p>30% of online shoppers now say&nbsp;they would be likely to make a purchase from a social media network like Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter or Snapchat[4]. Infringers have recognized the adoption of social buying platforms across the globe, and now use them to promote fake versions of leading branded products.</p>



<p>Established platforms such as Facebook, WeChat and Douyin [5] have inbuilt or planned ecommerce functionality. Infringers use this to link products in their posts to ecommerce sites. They then promote these posts and use targeted advertisements to expose fakes to a wider audience.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top">
<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><img width="300" height="254" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Marketplace-Icon_RGB-300x254.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3391" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Marketplace-Icon_RGB-300x254.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Marketplace-Icon_RGB.png 629w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>
</div>
</div>



<p>Group-buying platforms such as Pinduoduo are
also fast emerging with consumers grouping together to purchase products in
bulk, at a discount, direct from manufacturers.</p>



<p>Social media platforms without ecommerce functionality are also key hunting grounds for counterfeiters, with 60% of Instagram users&nbsp;saying they find new products on the platform[6].</p>



<p>Bad actors direct consumers to low-profile, illegitimate websites. Often, users are sent links via private message to transactions on services such as PayPal, AliPay or other equivalents. This provides a further headache for brand owners and warrants the use of advanced image-matching technology to locate the sellers responsible. </p>



<h3>How brands can combat social media infringers</h3>



<p><strong>29%</strong> of US consumers believe brands should be doing more to stop the purchase of counterfeit goods online, according to Incopro research. Brands must take a two-pronged approach to protect consumers from harmful fakes on social media. </p>



<h4>1. Collaboration</h4>



<p>It’s imperative to build strong working
relationships with social media platforms, join anti-counterfeiting
associations and work alongside law enforcement to tackle large-scale criminal
networks operating globally. </p>



<p>Insights into infringer activity and
concealment tactics can be shared and acted on together. For example, social
media platforms can allow investigators access to closed groups to locate
infringers and shut down their operations.</p>



<h4>2. Consumer awareness</h4>



<p>Consumers must also be made aware of the dangers of purchasing fakes and how to spot them online. Incopro research reveals that 29% have purchased or would consider purchasing fake toys – counterfeits with potentially devastating consequences if given to children.</p>



<p>Consumer awareness campaigns that span across brands&#8217; digital channels are critical. These campaigns should contain guides that tell consumers how to spot counterfeits and the official channels that they should only purchase from.</p>



<p>Some brands go one step further by providing an online form or tool on their website for consumers to report suspected counterfeit items. This alerts a brand to the existence of a particularly visible and high-risk product that could easily be purchased by unwitting consumers, enabling them to remove it quickly. </p>



<div class="wp-block-columns bg-grey--light">

<h2 class="heading-branded">Join a bigger gang</h2>



<p>Brands shouldn’t have to bear the brunt of criminal activity online. That’s why we are driving forward the agenda for closer collaboration between brands, platforms, and regulators. Only with a concerted, joint effort, can sophisticated global criminal networks be prevented from burying their roots into online platforms. </p>

<h2>According to new Incopro research, up to <strong>3 in 9</strong> first-page search results for branded baby teethers are for websites selling harmful or counterfeit products, posing danger to young children.</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Childrens-products_3-in-9-search-results-harmful_positive_RGB1.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>As total toy sales have slumped in the wake of the demise of US retail giant Toys “R” Us, ecommerce sales have been on the rise, representing a tectonic shift in the toy landscape.</p>



<p>Consumers now purchase toys from a wide array of relatively unknown online retailers, instead of trusted and well-established offline stores. They also purchase from marketplaces such as Amazon which, despite being widely regarded by consumers as a trustworthy platform, is known to contain thousands of counterfeit products.</p>



<p>Worryingly, consumers are increasingly being exposed to counterfeit toys and baby products on search engines in the run-up to seasonal events such as Black Friday and Christmas. Poorly-constructed fakes such as baby teethers have even been found to be available on popular marketplaces, putting young children at risk of choking.</p>



<p>A Senate Finance Committee staff report published on November 7 calls for U.S Customs and Border Protection to be able to share more information on counterfeits with private sector firms such as ecommerce platforms, but search engines themselves have a greater role to play in fighting online counterfeiting.</p>



<h3>The dangers of fake children’s products</h3>



<p>Toy brands abide by stringent regulation on materials and methods of manufacturing – and adhere to stricter regulation still for baby products. All items sold must also include detailed warnings and instructions to ensure their proper use.</p>



<p>Counterfeiters, on the other hand, care little about child safety and produce toys in unsanitary and unregulated environments, using poor-quality or even toxic parts.</p>



<p>Last December, it was reported that a 4-year-old child in the US was rushed to hospital after swallowing 13 tiny magnets exposed when a counterfeit toy broke apart <sup>[1]</sup>. The internal infection that spread as a result meant the child had to have parts of their colon and intestines removed, leaving them permanently scarred.</p>



<p>News publications initially identified the toy as ‘Magformers’, a magnetic construction set sold by a US firm. According to Inc.com, it was only after further investigation that it was revealed the product was a counterfeit produced by a Chinese company and, disturbingly, was widely available on marketplaces.</p>



<h3>Notorious online marketplaces found in search results</h3>



<p>Fake children’s products such as baby teethers are appearing at the top of search results and are readily available to consumers.</p>



<p>Incopro&#8217;s research reveals that searches for teethers contain a number of online marketplace listings – many of which offer fake or unsafe products. Of the first 10 results that would be displayed to a consumer, 32.5% directed to online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and ‘DHGate’. Of these, 65.4% appeared within the first five results on the page.</p>



<p>The chart below shows research on the volume of traffic that is directed via search engines to some of the largest global marketplaces that are gripped by counterfeiting.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Percentage-of-marketplace-traffic-from-organic-search_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>More than 50% of the traffic going to the notorious marketplaces ‘Prom’ (based in Ukraine), ‘Made-in-China’ and ‘DHGate’ (both based in China) is through organic search.</p></blockquote>



<p>Consumers finding and purchasing low-priced fakes on marketplaces outside of their home country is alarming. Many of these results are displayed when consumers search for branded toys and are designed to deceive them into thinking they are genuine.</p>



<h3>Searches for wholesale Comotomo teethers contain counterfeits</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Wholesale-Comotomo-teether_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>A keyword search on Google.com for “wholesale comotomo teether” presented nine organic search results, each of which directed to a marketplace or ecommerce site. Of the nine organic search results, three were for potentially harmful products that misused the Comotomo trademark (highlighted in red).<br><br><em>Screenshot: A keyword search on Google.com for “wholesale comotomo teether” (Incopro, 2019). Note: The first result is a paid advertisement</em></p>



<p>The second organic result is a link to a category page on Alibaba and not a specific product, making it more challenging to get the marketplace to take action.</p>



<p>The presence of the brand name confuses the consumer &#8211; the page lists products that are the same or similar to the Comotomo products but are sold at a fraction of the price and are potentially harmful.</p>



<p>The search result also uses metadata supplied by Alibaba as seen below. The impression given to the consumer is that they will be landing on a page with 150 Comotomo products &#8211; this is not the case.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba-category-metadata-Comotomo-Baby-Suppliers_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p><em>Screenshot: Metadata on Alibaba category page for ‘Comotomo Baby Suppliers’ (Incopro, 2019). </em></p>



<p>Below the Alibaba search result is an example of another type of wholesale supplier. ‘ywhgifts.com’ sells a wide variety of counterfeits, from teething toys to baby applicators and cell phone cases. This site continues to receive a huge share of traffic from organic search (76.89% over the past year) despite its status.</p>



<p>Brand names for these products are prominently displayed in these results, leading to confusion that these products are produced by Comotomo when several are not.</p>



<h2>Search engines must do more</h2>



<p>Brands can demand fake products be taken down from marketplaces, but this is of little practical use &#8211; it would not deal with the results pages hosted on these sites that are deceiving consumers.</p>



<p>Search engines, instead, need to get ahead of the game and provide a technology-based solution to tackle counterfeits. In doing so, they can demonstrate their willingness to proactively engage in wider anti-counterfeiting efforts alongside the government and ecommerce platforms and protect children from serious harm.</p>



<p>If they sit back and refuse, case law that extends liability to search engines for harmful counterfeits may come calling.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>New Incopro research reveals that 26% of US consumers have purchased a counterfeit online unintentionally in the last 12 months.</h2>
<p></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Ep3onOGCM0?rel=0" width="560" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em>Consumer research: </em><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Is fake the new real? Living in a fake society – US</em></a><em> (sample: 1,000 US consumers)</em></p>
<p>Hidden among promotions, online sales, and campaigns throughout the holiday season, are potentially dangerous counterfeit products putting consumers at risk that many remain unaware of.</p>
<p>This year, counterfeit seizures rose to US$1.4bn in the US alone [1]. And the likelihood is that potentially dangerous fakes many times greater than that value passed through borders uninhibited, ending up in US households.</p>
<p>With fake goods proliferating online through marketplaces, social media platforms, and illegitimate websites, this increasing threat to consumer safety throughout the holiday season should prompt brands to take urgent action.</p>
<h3>Threats this holiday season</h3>
<p>Online consumer spending is projected to exceed US$586bn in the US by the end of 2019<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;and continues its upward spiral as&nbsp;retail footfall declines. Consumers now purchase toys from a wide array of online retailers, instead of established offline stores. Marketplaces such as Amazon &#8211; which despite being widely regarded by consumers as a trustworthy platform &#8211; are known to be inundated with counterfeit products.</p>
<p>Infringers are finding it increasingly easy to distribute fake goods online, with shopping habits moving to these marketplaces and resale sites.</p>
<p>Incopro’s Brand Protection analysts discovered an increase in high-risk (likely counterfeit) listings on marketplaces in the run-up to Black Friday – the most popular period for purchasing Christmas gifts. For high-risk listings of a branded video game controller, we found:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On eBay &#8211;</strong> an increase of <strong>270% </strong>in average quantity sold weekly per listing by the end of November versus the beginning of the month</li>
<li><strong>On Amazon</strong> &#8211; an increase of <strong>41%</strong> in average weekly potential sales per listing by the end of November versus the beginning of the month</li>
</ul>
<p>Between November and December 2018, we discovered a 26% increase in infringing jewelry of a selection of luxury brands across all monitored online platforms. In the same period, instances of infringing premium watches also increased by 21%.</p>
<p>New <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us">Incopro consumer research</a> reveals that 27% of US consumers who have unintentionally purchased a counterfeit in the last 12 months have never received a refund after reporting a seller to a marketplace.</p>
<p>The research also discovered that 51% of US consumers conduct no or limited research on the authenticity of a product before purchasing it on Amazon. This is particularly alarming given that, as one of the world’s largest marketplaces, it continues to grapple with counterfeit products.</p>
<h3>Fake toys putting child safety at risk</h3>
<p>Baby product and toy manufacturers abide by stringent regulation covering materials, methods of production, and the inclusion of small parts.</p>
<p>Counterfeiters, on the other hand, care only about profit and little about child safety, producing toys in unsanitary and unregulated environments. They use poor-quality or toxic materials and often include loose parts that pose choking hazards. Fake versions of the branded Comotomo baby teether &#8211; one such counterfeit that could contain loose parts &#8211; can be found on the first page of Google search results, as discovered in recent research <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/how-and-why-search-engines-must-take-responsibility-for-tackling-counterfeiters">released by Incopro</a>.</p>
<p>A toy on many of this year’s Christmas lists is the ‘L.O.L Surprise! Doll’ which has been heavily counterfeited according to The Counterfeit Report<sup>[3]</sup>, putting children at risk of choking. Fake versions of this year’s popular children’s toys&nbsp;could also contain phthalates<sup>[4]</sup> – harmful chemicals that can damage organs.</p>
<p>Incopro’s consumer research revealed that 20% of US consumers have either intentionally purchased or considered purchasing fake toys, indicating that many are still unaware of the inherent dangers of these products. A further 9% purchased fake toys accidentally, highlighting their wide availability.</p>
<h3>Taking the fight to counterfeiters</h3>
<p>The US government has taken steps to stop the proliferation of fake toys online. The Stop All Nefarious Toys in America Act (SANTA Act) introduced this week, if passed, will mandate that marketplaces verify third-party seller details and make this information visible to consumers<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>
<p>Marketplaces will be required to display the seller’s full name, full business address, verified phone number, verified email address and notify buyers if the order is fulfilled by a seller other than the one displayed in the listing.</p>
<p>Counterfeiting operations ramp-up activity in the run-up to Christmas and pose a clear threat to consumers.&nbsp;However, with increased information now publicly available as per the SANTA Act, brands’ ability to identify and remove counterfeits before they reach consumers will be more effective.</p>
<p>To achieve a meaningful reduction in infringement, brands should monitor all activity and trends during the holiday season. And for each high-priority platform, you should have a comprehensive strategy in place and harness your relationship.</p>
<h2>Brand Protection technology that operates at scale</h2>
<p>Capturing actionable data on seasonal activity is an impossible task to undertake manually, however. Incopro’s Brand Protection platform, Talisman, allows you to make full use of your team’s resource by collecting a wide, relevant dataset that is then prioritized.</p>
<p>You will be able to&nbsp;focus your efforts on the largest infringers exploiting your brand during the holiday season to ensure maximum enforcement impact, protecting consumers and ecommerce revenue.</p>
<p>At Incopro, we work with our clients to ensure they protect their consumers and brand reputation online. We allow our customers to meaningfully reduce infringement and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/the-total-economic-impact-of-talisman">increase their online sales by targeting the largest infringers.</a>&nbsp;If you believe your brand is under threat and are interested to see how our technology can offer a long-term solution, request a free demo from one of our experts below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>
<h2>Black Friday and Cyber Monday, now worth a staggering US$14 billion<small class="rte-smalltext">[1]</small>, continue to be targeted by unscrupulous counterfeiters looking to exploit increased demand, and platforms are not doing enough to protect consumers and brands.</h2>
<p>Bad actors hide their fake products among genuine discounted goods, masking the suspiciously low pricing that consumers might associate with counterfeits. Even to the savviest of buyers, counterfeits become difficult to identify within a sea of constantly changing offers and flash-sales.</p>
<p>With up to 90% of consumers price checking a product on Amazon, even after finding it on a retailers’ page first[2], genuine sellers are immediately put at a disadvantage during sale events.</p>
<h3>Counterfeits increasingly offered to consumers in the run-up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h3>
<p>Increasingly, we see counterfeiters enrolling in pre-sale campaigns. Using Talisman, Incopro’s <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectiontechnology">online brand protection technology</a>, our analysts detected a spike in infringement activity for a premium<br><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Increase-in-counterfeiting-in-the-run-up-to-Black-Friday-1024x605.png" alt=""><br>footwear brand on Amazon in the run-up to Black Friday 2018<strong>. 24,257 high-risk listings</strong> were identified in November 2018 compared to 8,096 high-risk listings in October, representing an increase of almost <strong>300%.</strong> A high-risk listing is one that has been identified to likely be a counterfeit.</p>
<h4>Black Friday 2019 infringement:</h4>
<ul>
<li>eBay &#8211; <strong>15,989 high-risk listings</strong> were identified for a premium fashion brand in November, compared to 8,588 in October &#8211; representing an increase of <strong>86%.</strong></li>
<li>Amazon &#8211; <strong>562 high-risk listings</strong> were detected for a leading cosmetics brand in November, compared to 212 in October &#8211; revealing an increase of <strong>165%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in infringement is echoed on social media. For one luxury brand, our analysts discovered a <strong>233%</strong> increase in Instagram posts using the hashtag ‘#blackfriday’ to promote counterfeit watches during the four-week run-up.</p>
<h3>Dangerous fake toys sold to consumers through Amazon</h3>
<p>In 2014, fake versions of the <em>‘Mustachifier’ </em>branded baby pacifier were sold through Amazon. The product broke in two when used and led to a child in the US almost choking on the loose parts.</p>
<p>A separate incident in 2018 led to a child having parts of their colon removed after swallowing 13 tiny magnets from a Chinese copycat of a<em> ‘Magformers’</em> toy[3]. These fakes were widely available on Amazon and, even after being removed, it is unclear whether they were ever recalled.</p>
<p>Sellers aren&#8217;t required to provide any certification when listing children’s products on Amazon. The company only <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200292910?language=en-US">states</a> that &#8220;Sellers are responsible for tracking and complying with any regulations issued by the CPSC [Consumer Product Safety Commission]&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Counterfeiters exploit the Amazon ‘ASIN’</h3>
<p>The ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) is the unique offer identifier on Amazon, with each home to an individual product. Amazon requires brands to share ASINs with other sellers of the same product, but these sellers are not required to prove that their versions are legitimate.</p>
<p>Amazon algorithms favor top-selling and ‘best-value’ products. This helps counterfeit ASINs appear front and center.</p>
<h3>The Amazon buy box – a game of tug of war for brands</h3>
<p>82% of sales on Amazon are through the buy box[4]. The buy box contains the ‘buy now’ button and appears at the top of the Amazon listing. It is owned by only a single seller at any one time but will often change hands throughout the day.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amazon-buy-box-screenshot_small.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>Obtaining the buy box is an art-form which has been perfected by counterfeiters. With price a major determinant, Amazon algorithms favor counterfeiters over legitimate sellers who comply with minimum advertised prices (MAP) set by brands.<br><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amazon-Buy-box-criteria-exploited-by-counterfeiters.png" alt=""><br>The ruthless and fast-paced nature of the buy box offers the perfect battle ground for counterfeiters during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Counterfeiters discount their products to hijack the buy box for a short period, appearing legitimate to consumers during a sale event.</p>
<h3>Platforms slow to protect consumers during the holiday season</h3>
<p>Marketplaces are clearly vulnerable during the holiday season and are slow to react to increased levels of infringement, with some taking longer to remove counterfeit listings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“ eBay aims to remove counterfeit listings within 24 hours. However, this November we have noted that on some occasions the platform is taking up to 5 days to remove high-risk listings.”<br>&#8211; </strong>Katerina Pribanova, Incopro Brand Protection Sub-Team Leader</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A delay in removal can reduce its overall impact. If a counterfeit is only taken down after sale events have ended, the damage may have already been done.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, Incopro analysts have discovered that online enforcement forms on ‘Shopee’ (a marketplace notorious for counterfeits) have been disabled since November 26, possibly as a cynical attempt to reduce takedowns before this week’s sale events.</p>
<h3>What can brands do?</h3>
<p>It is essential that brands monitor infringement trends in the run-up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And as the phenomena continue to expand to new markets, they must look further afield too.</p>
<p>For each high-priority platform, you should have a comprehensive strategy in place. Our proposed strategy for Amazon during the holiday season is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monitor the buy box on your listings closely</li>
<li>Proactively defend your brand on Amazon by signing up to Brand Registry and ‘gate’ high-priority ASINs (the ASIN is the unique offer identifier on Amazon)</li>
<li>Monitor non-gated authorized ASINs and look for duplicates</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Amazon’s Brand Registry</strong> offers a number of tools to help brands manage their presence on the marketplace and to remove infringing products, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bulk enforcement of counterfeit ASINs</li>
<li>Merging duplicate ASINs</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><br>ASIN gating</strong> refers to the practice of ‘locking’ authorized ASINs so that only a select list of verified sellers can operate on it. Brands should be aware that it is only available to those enrolled in the Brand Registry. It is a paid service and is reserved for a select number of your listings.</p>
<p>As always, there are caveats. Brands require a trademark to register for the Brand Registry; those with design rights or other forms of IP are currently locked out of the program. Amazon also does not effectively police the Brand Registry across different regions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you will require sophisticated <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectiontechnology">Brand Protection technology</a> that can work in tandem with a platform’s own anti-counterfeiting tools.</p>
<h2>A Brand Protection solution</h2>
<p>Using brand protection technology, you will be able to <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#benefitsofbrandprotection">measure the impact of enforcement</a> and prioritize activity by region and risk.</p>

We allow our customers to meaningfully reduce online infringement and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/the-total-economic-impact-of-talisman">increase their online sales by targeting the largest infringers.</a>&nbsp;If you believe your brand is under threat and are interested to see how our technology can offer a long-term solution to online infringement, request a free demo from one of our experts below.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Alibaba once again smashed records this Singles’ Day by registering over US$38 billion in sales, up from $30 billion in 2018. However, hidden amongst the thousands of third-party sellers taking part were opportunistic counterfeiters using the cover of discounts to peddle low-quality products.</h2>
<p>Singles’ Day, the ecommerce phenomenon in China and South-East Asia, continues to outpace Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Thanksgiving weekend. The scale of the event is huge; combined, Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2018 achieved less than half the value of sales by comparison [1] [2], while ecommerce giant Amazon only managed a comparatively minor $7.16bn [3] in sales during its ‘Prime Day’ in 2019.</p>
<p>This year, electronic gadgets and fashion items were among the top product categories. New categories included cars and travel, with packages to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and tickets for Disney’s theme park in Shanghai available at a discount.</p>
<h3>Opportunistic counterfeiters continue to exploit ecommerce events</h3>
<p>Over 40% of the products sold online in China are fake or of poor quality, according to a state media report released in 2019 [4]. Ecommerce platforms continue to be plagued by counterfeiting, and widespread discounting is seen as the perfect cover for infringement.</p>
<p>Social ecommerce platforms have even been set up solely to help consumers sift through the millions of offers and discounts available on Singles’ Day. RED is emerging as the most popular of these platforms and now has over&nbsp;200 million registered users.</p>
<p>Low pricing, often seen as suspicious to savvy consumers, no longer looks out of place next to other similarly priced listings, and deal comparison services do little to verify the legitimacy of the products included in the deals.</p>
<h3>Counterfeiting trends this year</h3>
<p>Incopro’s brand protection analysts actively monitor infringement activity in the run-up to Singles’ Day and through the 24-hour sale period. This year, they pointed to the increased length of pre-sale campaigns in comparison to 2018 as an opportunity for counterfeiters. Bad actors were able to sell higher volumes of fakes and attempt to evade detection by listing their products before the ecommerce event fully kicked off.<br><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Singles-Day-2019-marketplace-pre-sale-campaigns.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Singles’ Day 2019 pre-sale campaigns and promotions by marketplace (Incopro, 2019)</em></p>
<p>93 luxury brands were involved in this year’s ‘1111’ (11<sup>th</sup> November) promotions on Tmall. More than 40 of these brands participated in the event for the first time. Luxury brands continued to be targeted by bad actors who used large discounts to appeal to price-sensitive consumers.</p>
<p>We identified that for one luxury brand there were several spikes in high-risk listings in the four-week run-up to Singles’ Day. Particularly noteworthy was a spike of 171 individual listings on the 19<sup>th</sup> of October, just two days before Tmall’s sales campaign launched and one day after JD.com’s had launched.</p>
<p>International brands accounted for over 40% of total purchases during Singles’ Day 2018, demonstrating their appeal to the Chinese market. Indeed, this trend continues to grow; 60% of consumers in China indicated that they intended to purchase imported products this Singles’ Day [5].</p>
<p>We detected the highest volume of counterfeit listings on the marketplace Taobao. On JD.com, we noted a high number of copyright infringements amongst listings participating in ‘1111’ promotions, namely sellers taking copyright imagery and photography from brands’ official websites. Group-buying platform Pinduoduo was also found to have a number of counterfeits enrolled in the promotions.</p>
<h3>What can brands do?</h3>
<p>A truly <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectionstrategy">comprehensive brand protection strategy</a> is essential if brands are to meaningfully reduce online counterfeiting during high-profile ecommerce events. Brands should ensure they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invest in a sophisticated technology solution</li>
<li>Use platform anti-counterfeiting tools effectively</li>
<li>Maintain a watertight IP portfolio</li>
<li>Fully understand local IP law and the documentation required by platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Platforms shouldn’t be relied upon alone to detect and remove infringements. Instead, brands should invest in technology that can identify and enforce against entire networks of infringers rather than individual listings or accounts.</p>
<h2>Online Brand Protection key to reducing infringement</h2>
<p>Brands must be prepared to face threats online from opportunistic infringers that exploit increased demand; it is critical to factor in holidays, sales and other events into your brand protection strategy.</p>
<p>With ecommerce platforms starting their pre-sale campaigns earlier and earlier each year, it is essential that brands widen the scope of monitoring and look at infringement trends well in advance of the final sale period. And as ecommerce events such as Singles’ Day continue to expand into new markets such as the UK and US, brands must ensure that they also patrol western marketplaces in addition to those in China and South-East Asia.</p>
<p>At Incopro, we work with our clients to ensure they protect their consumers and brand reputation online. We allow our customers to meaningfully reduce online infringement and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/the-total-economic-impact-of-talisman">increase their online sales by targeting the largest infringers.</a> If you believe your brand is under threat and are interested to see how our technology can offer a long-term solution to online infringement, request a free demo from one of our experts below.<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size" id="h-singles-day-is-the-world-s-largest-ecommerce-festival-and-is-heavily-targeted-by-opportunistic-counterfeiters-posing-a-risk-to-consumers-and-brands"><strong>Singles’ Day is the world’s largest ecommerce festival and is heavily targeted by opportunistic counterfeiters, posing a risk to consumers and brands.</strong></p>



<p>Singles’ Day is the Chinese retail and ecommerce phenomenon that has skyrocketed in popularity over the last six years, outpacing similar sale events that are hosted throughout the globe. The scale of the event is huge; combined, Black Friday and Cyber Monday only achieved half as many sales by comparison in 2018 [1] [2], while Amazon only generated a comparatively minor $7.16bn [3] in sales during its ‘Prime Day’ in 2019.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-singles-day">What is Singles’ Day?</h3>



<p>Taking place on November 11, Singles’ Day was first conceived as an ‘anti-Valentine’s Day’ celebration by Chinese students in 1993. The holiday rose to prominence in 2009 when Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba encouraged brands and third-party sellers using its platforms to offer large discounts on everyday consumer goods for a 24-hour period, in the same vein as the then-emerging ‘Black Friday’. Alibaba signaled its ambitious intentions for the holiday by trademarking the term ‘shuangshiyi’ (double eleven) in 2012 to represent the date ‘11/11’.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="880" height="650" src="https://mk0incoprorqrlirgki5.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba_Sales_Graph_v2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-915" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba_Sales_Graph_v2.png 880w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba_Sales_Graph_v2-300x222.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba_Sales_Graph_v2-768x567.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption><em>GMV for Alibaba ecommerce sales on Singles’ Day (Statista, 2019)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fast forward to 2017, and the event began to see offline expansion. Alibaba set up 60 pop-up stores across China and collaborated with retailers to launch 100,000 smart shops. A shopping mall in Hangzhou, China, was even opened in April 2018 in response to concerns that the Chinese ecommerce market was beginning to plateau.</p>



<p>With a third of the Chinese population purchasing items during Singles’ Day alone, Alibaba is expected to generate an eye-watering US$37bn in gross merchandising value from the event.</p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p>This year will see the expansion of available products to combat the knock-on effects from the ongoing US-China trade war. New product categories include cars and travel, with packages to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and discounted tickets for Disney’s theme park in Shanghai available.</p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p>China continues to be one of the world’s largest counterfeiting hotspots; over 40% of goods sold online in China are fakes or of poor quality, according to a state media report released in early 2019 [4].</p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>

<p>International brands accounted for over 40% of total purchases during Singles’ Day 2018, demonstrating their appeal to the Chinese market. Indeed this trend increases to grow; 60% of Chinese consumers intend to purchase imported products this Singles’ Day [5].</p>

<p>Worryingly for brand owners, America’s trade war with China is likely to increase the size of the counterfeit market in both China and the US by making imported genuine products more expensive and stretching the resources already deployed towards fighting illicit trade [6].</p>

<p>As Singles’ Day expands into developing countries in Southeast Asia following Alibaba’s acquisition of marketplace ‘Lazada’, the threat of counterfeiting to brands is increasing.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Incopro brand advisor Tosshan Ramgolam states: “Listings taking part in Singles’ Day promotions feature banner images next to the price. Talisman, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/products/talisman-online-brand-protection">Incopro’s brand protection tool</a>, collects the text in these banners and uses that as an indicator for risk to monitor counterfeiting activity for brands”.</p></blockquote>



<h3 id="h-other-marketplaces-also-facing-counterfeiting-threats">Other marketplaces also facing counterfeiting threats</h3>



<p>Other platforms such as Pinduoduo, a ‘group-buying’ platform, take part in the event. The platform is used alongside immensely popular WeChat (China’s equivalent of WhatsApp) for social shopping, and now boasts over 483.2 million users, representing growth of over 42% since 2018 [7].</p>



<p>The platform is frequented by wholesale buyers who purchase in bulk to sell products to consumers through other ecommerce channels across the globe.</p>



<p>Counterfeiters attempt to entice both price-sensitive buyers and those that intentionally purchase fakes on Pinduoduo, and there are fewer intermediaries within the supply chain to scrutinize product authenticity. As a result, the platform has received numerous complaints of very low product quality and fake products and was added to the US government’s counterfeit ‘blacklist’ in April 2019.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-can-brands-do">What can brands do?</h3>



<p>Whilst there is clear progress being made by marketplaces, social media platforms, and the Chinese government to combat IP infringement, brands need to be proactive.</p>



<p>A truly <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectionstrategy">comprehensive brand protection strategy</a> is essential and must combine a sophisticated technology solution, platform anti-counterfeiting tools, a well-maintained IP portfolio, and effective enforcement using local IP laws.</p>



<h4 id="h-register-your-intellectual-property-internationally">Register your intellectual property internationally</h4>



<p>It is crucial to register your IP to comply with the law in each territory where you believe your products will be in demand, regardless of whether you plan to sell there. Infringers will exploit any gaps in your IP portfolio to frustrate the enforcement process.</p>



<h4 id="h-develop-relationships-with-marketplaces-and-platforms">Develop relationships with marketplaces and platforms</h4>



<p>Brands should develop strong collaborative relationships with platforms, particularly in regions where your product is highly targeted. Many marketplaces such as Alibaba, Tmall and WeChat run brand protection schemes that aim to expedite the enforcement process.</p>



<h4 id="h-employ-intelligence-led-brand-protection-techniques">Employ intelligence-led brand protection techniques</h4>



<p>Brands shouldn’t rely on platforms alone to detect and remove infringements. Instead, they should invest in brand protection technology that can identify entire networks of infringers rather than individual accounts or listings. With this strategic approach, they can discover large-scale illicit networks, send notices against all entities, or utilize intelligence for offline action.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-online-brand-protection-key-to-reducing-infringement">Online Brand Protection key to reducing infringement</h2>
