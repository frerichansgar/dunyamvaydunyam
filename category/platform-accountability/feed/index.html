<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2021 posed unique challenges to brand protection teams, with online threats increasingly varied, supply chains disrupted, and department budgets tightening.</strong></p>



<p>Throughout this year however, members of the global brand protection community INSYNC remained resolute in their goal to protect consumers, with teams continually adapting to the fast-evolving online environment. Quotes and insights from the INSYNC community show teams responding to prolonged global uncertainty and shifts in online behavior by refocusing strategy, collaborating with internal teams, and building relationships with e-commerce platforms.</p>



<p>Read this blog to learn about the key developments within the industry in 2021, including emerging threats, new legislation, and innovative approaches to brand protection strategy.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Emerging threats in 2021</h2>



<p>The pandemic has continued to disrupt supply chains across the globe, meaning consumers have had difficulty in obtaining certain branded products. Counterfeiters and other bad actors have seized this opportunity to impersonate brands and defraud consumers.</p>



<h3 id="h-social-media-phishing-and-scams">Social media phishing and scams</h3>



<p>Brands in 2021 faced a growing tide of phishing scams and other types of fraud targeting their customers on social media.</p>



<p>Social media cybercrime generates a staggering&nbsp;<strong>$3.25</strong> billion&nbsp;for criminal networks annually[1]. <strong>61%</strong> of companies&nbsp;experience phishing attacks via their social media channels[2]. And as social media usage continues to increase, scammers have sought new methods to exploit brands and consumers.</p>



<p>Facebook and Instagram have emerged as popular platforms for fake ‘brand giveaways’, where scammers impersonate well-known brands advertising offering free product giveaways. Once consumers submit their personal information, the scammers use this to conduct identity and financial fraud.</p>



<p>In a sign of growing frustration from authorities, the&nbsp;head of enforcement at the FCA (UK) stated:</p>



<p><em>“Social media sites are effectively a gateway in which scammers are getting access to vast numbers of people in the population through online searches.”[3]</em></p>



<p>While platforms are taking steps to combat scammers, it is clear they can go further. Businesses too must adapt their brand protection strategies to safeguard consumers’ digital safety and trust on social media as threats continue to grow.</p>

<h3>COVID-related scams</h3>



<p>Brands and consumers contended with a barrage of COVID-related scams and fake products during 2021. These threats included:</p>



<h4>Listings for COVID vaccines on B2B &amp; B2C marketplaces</h4>



<p>Incopro’s experts have detected several unauthorized listings claiming to be ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Direct Suppliers’ on B2B platforms EC21, Ecplaza, and Tradekey. With the listings not directly referring to branded vaccines, identifying the key platforms sellers use to advertise these fake or unauthorized products plays a significant role in proactive enforcement.</p>



<p>COVID vaccine listings can often also be found on B2C platforms such as eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist. These usually involve sellers offering slots to get the vaccine. COVID vaccine manufacturers have confirmed to Incopro that the majority of these online offers are scams.</p>



<h4>Criminals selling COVID-related products</h4>



<p>Fake vaccine passports / certificates and even COVID test results are being sold on e-commerce websites and, increasingly, the dark web[4].</p>



<p>Law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) in the US are pursuing false COVID-related products and are notifying registrars when their services are used by bad actors. However, with over 1,000 COVID-related domains being registered per day, it’s clear that registrars and web hosts need to do more.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Legislation targeting platforms – EU</h2>



<p>On the legislative front 2021 heralded many promising changes, with increased pressure placed on e-commerce platforms and other online intermediaries.</p>



<p>In December 2020, The European Commission published its much-anticipated&nbsp;Digital Services Act package of measures<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;in what may amount potentially to the most sweeping reforms to tech regulation in Europe for more than two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two separate pieces of legislation (the&nbsp;Digital Services Act&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Digital Markets Act) appear to signify the arrival of root and branch reform to the Internet platform economy, assuming the draft texts are adopted by the European Parliament and are enacted into law.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The Digital Services Act (DSA)</h3>



<p>The DSA is designed to regulate the way in which platforms handle illegal or harmful content in their capacity as intermediaries which connect consumers with goods, services and content.</p>



<p>A central theme to the DSA is the notion that technology companies will need now to take much more responsibility for unlawful behavior on their platforms – and will face serious financial penalties if they do not.</p>



<p>While brand owners welcome the proposed legislation, there are several key improvements that are needed. Perhaps most critical of these are:</p>



<ul><li>Trusted Flaggers – ‘Trusted Flagger’ rules should apply to all hosting services and trusted flagger status should be available to all entities which demonstrate expertise and a high rate of accuracy when flagging content regardless of whether or not they are part of trade associations or collective bodies.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Repeat Infringers – The scope of this provision is too narrow; it needs to apply to all hosting services (e.g. cyberlockers). It should also permit the termination of the provision of services in egregious cases – for example in cases of repeated suspension.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/the-digital-services-act-what-do-brand-and-content-owners-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about DSA changes requested by brand owners &gt;</a></p>



<h3>The Digital Markets Act (DMA)</h3>



<p>In contrast to the DSA,&nbsp;the DMA&nbsp;applies to large online platforms which act as “Gatekeepers” in digital markets – acting as critical gateways for business users to reach end users (consumers). This includes search engines, intermediation services, social networking services, video-sharing platforms, operating systems, interpersonal communication services, cloud computing and advertising[6].</p>



<p>The DMA seeks to regulate these platforms to ensure that the markets in which they operate remain fair and competitive. The DMA imposes restrictions and obligations to ensure that Gatekeeper platforms behave in a fair way online.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Legislation targeting platforms – US</h2>



<p>Similar trends were observed in the US, with legislators increasing looking at the role of platforms and online intermediaries in facilitating the sale or access of infringing products and services.</p>



<h3>The Shop Safe Act</h3>



<p>The US Shop Safe Act Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 (The Lanham Act), with the addition of a section to make e-commerce platforms liable for trademark infringement and counterfeiting if they do not follow a number of best practices such as screening sellers and enforcing against repeat infringers.</p>



<h3>The INFORM Consumers Act</h3>



<p>The US INFORM Consumers Act (The Integrity, Notification, and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers), requires online marketplaces to collect, verify and disclose certain information from high-volume third-party sellers.</p>



<p>Following discussions in the senate, e-commerce platforms lobbied to define high-volume third-party sellers to include those that conduct 200 or more transactions resulting in total revenues of $7,000 or more during a continuous 12-month period.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/shop-safe-inform-consumers-act-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about US legislative developments &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Increased focus on repeat infringers</h2>



<p>In early 2021 Incopro released ‘Three Strikes and Out’, a white paper that explores how e-commerce platforms can tackle repeat infringers – an issue that brand owners are increasingly highlighting.</p>



<p>We found that <strong>23</strong> of the <strong>34</strong> e-commerce platforms considered have a policy directed at repeat infringers. The remaining <strong>11</strong> had no relevant policy evident. Out of the <strong>23</strong> e-commerce platforms that have a policy, only 3 had enacted a three-strikes rule.</p>



<p>We noted that platforms that do have a clear ‘three strikes’ rule and robust seller verification process – such as Aliexpress – see fewer repeat infringements than other platforms.</p>



<p>The white paper analyzed over 1.5m enforcements to help understand the scale of the issue, before setting out how brands, platforms and legislators can address the challenge to protect consumers, reduce losses suffered to counterfeiting and support rights holders.</p>



<p>Incopro’s analysis shows that:</p>



<ul><li>Only&nbsp;<strong>6%</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;sellers&nbsp;are&nbsp;repeatedly enforced on <strong>3 days</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>more</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>However, these sellers are responsible for over&nbsp;<strong>24%</strong>&nbsp;of the listings Incopro has enforced against&nbsp;</li><li>The models show that&nbsp;a seller verification and repeat infringer policy would significantly benefit consumers, brands, legislators, and the platforms themselves</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/three-strikes-and-out-how-e-commerce-platforms-can-protect-consumers-from-repeat-offenders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read the full findings and policy recommendations &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Recognition of outcomes, not takedowns</h2>



<p><strong>“It’s important we’re not seen as ‘whack-a-mole’. It’s only whack-a-mole if you don’t apply data.”</strong></p>



<p><em>Gary Wengrofsky, Senior Director, Intellectual Property, Charter Communications speaking at the INSYNC Virtual Summit: November 2021</em></p>



<p>In 2021, the shift towards outcomes picked up pace. Many brand protection teams now set KPIs that focus on reducing the volume of infringement and cleaning up priority platforms, rather than the number of takedown notices sent.</p>



<p>With this approach, teams can free up resources for both targeted enforcement against high-risk infringements and to conduct in-depth data analysis and other value-adding activities. They can then deliver commercial value to the business and vastly increase return on investment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/brand-protection-kpis-how-to-focus-on-outcomes-not-takedowns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn how shifting the focus to outcomes delivers greater long-term value &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">A new brand protection maturity model</h2>



<p>With threats growing in both scale and variety, brand protection teams had a huge amount of ground to cover in 2021. From counterfeit goods and copycats, to fake NFTs and social media phishing scams, there are countless ways a company&#8217;s identity can be infringed and damaged online. The threats each business and industry faces vary, but there are general steps all organizations can take to evolve their approach.</p>



<p>As they mature, teams become an increasingly strategic asset — able not only to counter threats, but to identify new growth opportunities for the business.</p>



<p>In 2021, Incopro released an Online Brand Protection Maturity Report that outlines the four stages of this journey. From reactive teams that find themselves firefighting infringements, to effective teams that make use of advanced technology to tackle issues at scale, to progressive teams that champion wider applications of brand protection within their organizations.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>New Incopro research reveals that 1 in 5 fake listings come from only 3% of illicit sellers.</strong> <strong>Up&nbsp;to $78bn in annual losses could be prevented if platforms proactively removed these repeat breachers.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/three-strikes-and-out-how-e-commerce-platforms-can-protect-consumers-from-repeat-offenders/#download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incopro’s recent white paper</a> provides brands, e-commerce platforms and legislators with data on the proportion of repeat infringements undertaken by the same sellers, who use key global online marketplaces and social media platforms to infringe intellectual property.</p>



<p>The white paper also reports on the policies and procedures for repeat infringements currently employed by major online e-commerce platforms. </p>



<p>Finally, it presents detailed findings on the reduction in online counterfeiting and the commercial savings that could be secured if key e-commerce platforms combined:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>1. robust seller verification; and</strong></li><li><strong>2. a “three strikes and out” rule.</strong></li></ul>



<h3 id="h-what-is-a-repeat-breacher">What is a repeat breacher?</h3>



<p><strong>For the purpose of our study, we define repeat breachers as sellers that host multiple listings which infringe brand owners’ intellectual property (and/or repeatedly infringe platform policies).</strong></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-e-commerce-platforms-and-repeat-breachers">E-commerce platforms and repeat breachers</h2>



<p>Forrester&nbsp;estimates that 82% of global B2C e-commerce growth over the past few years came from marketplaces [1]. Bad actors have been swift to exploit this growth, with the global economic value of counterfeiting and piracy potentially reaching $4.2 trillion USD by 2022 placing 5.4 million legitimate jobs at risk [2].</p>



<p>Incopro’s data shows that the&nbsp;proportion of&nbsp;sellers who&nbsp;repeatedly infringe rights and harm consumers&nbsp;typically&nbsp;comprises&nbsp;under <strong>3%</strong> of&nbsp;the total sellers enforced,&nbsp;but&nbsp;these&nbsp;sellers are responsible, on average, for over <strong>20%</strong> of the illicit issues detected and notified on the e-commerce operations considered in the study.</p>



<p>Draft legislation in both the US (such as the SHOP SAFE and SANTA Acts) and Europe (such as the Digital Services Act) contemplates requiring online e-commerce platforms to take steps to verify and authenticate sellers and promoters before they can use the platform. The legislation also considers requiring these platforms to implement policies to stop sellers who repeatedly infringe intellectual property. You can read a summary of the draft legislation <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/can-the-current-regulatory-landscape-tackle-growing-brand-misuse-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Our white paper focuses on providing evidence to inform the discussion on proposed legislative changes. The following is an example of what can occur in the absence of a seller verification and a three-strikes rule:</p>



<p><strong>In the course of 2020, a seller used the same e-commerce operation in Latin America to offer consumer goods for sale. In total, Breaches in respect of 9 different consumer brands were found by Incopro’s technology. On each occasion, Incopro’s technology notified the e-commerce operation of the Breach and the seller’s online identification. The e-commerce operation was asked to remove the offer for sale. Over the course of a year, 107 different Breaches were identified. On one day, 27 separate Breaches that each offered a fake or inferior product for sale were reported to the e-commerce operation.</strong></p>



<p>This bar chart&nbsp;below&nbsp;identifies the time period for the Breaches and notifications to the e-commerce operation.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="689" height="505" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14324" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1.png 689w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /></figure>



<p>Although this e-commerce operation was notified about the same seller on 27 separate days &#8211; and with increasing frequency, this seller was not suspended. The seller was free to continue to use the platform to offer goods that might place consumers at risk.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-current-platform-policies">Current Platform Policies</h2>



<p>Platforms can protect both brands and consumers by effectively tackling repeat breachers. However, policies currently adopted by many platforms do not do enough to prevent repeat infringement.</p>



<p>Our findings indicate:</p>



<ul><li><strong>23</strong> <strong>out of the</strong> <strong>34</strong> platforms investigated have a policy against repeat breachers that is readily available to users &#8211; the remaining <strong>11</strong> have no relevant policy evident.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Out of the</strong> <strong>23</strong> platforms that have a policy directed at repeat breachers, only <strong>3</strong> have a policy which includes the 3-strike rule. These <strong>3</strong> platforms are based in the APAC region, and three serious offences on separate occasions result in account termination.</li></ul>



<p><strong>10 out of 23 </strong>platforms with a relevant policy have published definitions of the duration of account suspension. Again, amongst these <strong>10</strong> platforms only <strong>2</strong> have a policy that considers repeat offences sufficient ground for immediate termination.</p>



<p>It is noticeable that platforms like Aliexpress, which has a clear ‘three strikes’ rule and robust seller verification process, sees fewer repeat breaches than other platforms. Similarly, while Facebook and Instagram prefer not to disclose their policies publicly (to avoid gaming by bad actors), we are aware that they pay close attention to the issue of repeat breaches.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-new-methods-for-tackling-repeat-breachers">New methods for tackling repeat breachers</h2>



<h3 id="h-robust-seller-verification">Robust seller verification</h3>



<p>Platforms could require sellers to verify their identity before allowing them to advertise products for sale. This would serve to dissuade some bad actors from using these platforms, while also making enforcement and further action easier if they do go through the verification process. Seller verification is commonly achieved through credit card, bank statements or utility bills, or through government-issued identification cards.</p>



<p>Some platforms, such as Amazon and Alibaba, have already brought in forms of seller verification – although these policies could be strengthened. Others have yet to commit to seller verification, and consumers continue to be put at risk by anonymous seller accounts.</p>



<p><strong>Additional to robust seller verification, platforms should bring in a simple ‘three-strikes-and-out’ policy to tackle repeat infringement. Below, we have outlined two different thresholds that could be adopted.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-three-strikes-and-out-model-1-threshold-3-separate-days-of-enforcement">Three Strikes and Out Model 1: Threshold = 3 separate days of enforcement</h3>



<p>Platforms could adopt a policy where a seller is blocked from advertising further products for sale when a limit of 3 separate days of enforcement is reached.</p>



<h3 id="h-three-strikes-and-out-model-2-threshold-3-enforced-listings">Three Strikes and Out Model 2: Threshold = 3 enforced listings</h3>



<p>Alternatively, platforms could adopt a policy where a seller is blocked from advertising further listings when a limit of 3 enforced listings is reached. In the White Paper, this is modelled by grouping data based on the number of separate listings that have been enforced.</p>



<h3 id="h-three-strikes-in-action-japanese-marketplace">Three Strikes in action &#8211; Japanese marketplace</h3>



<p>A seller used an e-commerce platform in Japan and created <strong>2,063 </strong>separate listings under the same name for products copying the intellectual property of a fashion brand protected by Incopro. Incopro’s technology discovered these listings as they appeared over the course of the year. Each time listings were discovered, notices were sent to the e-commerce operation to remove the products. Notices were sent on <strong>42 </strong>separate days over the course of the year. Each time, the notified listings were removed by the platform, but the seller was able to continue listing offers on that platform.</p>



<p>If the seller had been stopped from using the marketplace after 3 listings were reported and removed, at least <strong>2,060 </strong>of the seller’s infringing listings would not have required enforcement (see figure 2 below).</p>

<h3 id="h-1-commercial-savings">1. <strong>Commercial savings </strong></h3>



<p>Implementing either of these models could deliver reduce the availability of potentially harmful or low quality, non-genuine products to consumers by a minimum of <strong>11%</strong>&nbsp;(Model 1)&nbsp;or up to <strong>24%</strong>&nbsp;(Model 2). Given the losses suffered to online counterfeiting are estimated at over <strong>$320bn</strong> annually, this could equate to consumer savings of <strong>$35bn</strong> under Model 1 and up to <strong>$78bn</strong> under Model 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-protecting-consumers">2. Protecting consumers</h3>



<p>However, the benefit is not just financial. Non-genuine listings and counterfeits are often low-quality products, or those that may not meet regulatory standards, and are therefore highly likely to&nbsp;pose risks to consumer health and safety. </p>



<h3 id="h-3-platforms-benefit">3. Platforms benefit</h3>



<p>Additionally, given research suggests <strong>33%</strong> of consumers hold e-commerce operation responsible for addressing these issues, and <strong>64%</strong> of consumers have lost trust in a platform after unintentionally buying counterfeit products on that platform, addressing this issue effectively is also likely to drive the commercial success of e-commerce marketplaces [3].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>More needs to be done to stop bad actors from misusing e-commerce platforms to infringe rights and harm consumers. With consumers increasingly using&nbsp;e-commerce platforms to buy products and secure services, it is critical for platforms and law makers to act.</strong></p>



<p>E-commerce platforms are essential to our everyday lives but are not properly regulated &#8211; in stark contrast to many other areas of the online ecosystem. In this blog, we explore the acceleration in e-commerce and look at the legislation that lawmakers are hoping will even the playing field against emboldened bad actors online.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">The Acceleration in E-Commerce and Risk of Consumer Harm</h2>



<p>Supercharged by the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce is the fastest growing retail segment in Europe and in North America[1]. According to Adobe’s Digital Economy Index (published February 2021), there was 42% year-over-year (YoY) e-commerce growth in 2020 [2]. In 2021, this acceleration in e-commerce is showing no little sign of slowing down, with 34% YoY growth between Jan and Feb 2021.</p>



<p>According to eMarketer, US based sales from ecommerce in 2020 were approximately $794.5 Bn USD, an increase of 32% year-on-year[3].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Significantly, this growth is being driven primarily by online marketplaces rather than e-commerce websites operated by traditional brick-and-mortar brands. Forrester&nbsp;estimates that 82% of global B2C e-commerce growth came from marketplaces – demonstrating the importance of effective consumer protection on these channels[4].</p>



<h3 id="h-brand-misuse-continues-to-grow-online">Brand Misuse Continues to Grow Online</h3>



<p>Bad actors have been swift to exploit e-commerce growth. It is estimated that the global economic value of counterfeiting and piracy could reach $4.2 trillion USD by 2022, placing 5.4 million legitimate jobs at risk[5].</p>



<p>Key figures:</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>The OECD estimates that trade in fake goods (as of March 2019) is <strong>3.3%</strong> of global trade and rising[6].&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>As of June 2020, EUIPO &amp; the OECD estimates that that the extent of counterfeit goods in global trade has reached as much as <strong>$509 billion</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>EUIPO &amp; the OECD the estimated direct and indirect sales losses attributable to counterfeiting in Europe amount to <strong>EUR 83</strong> billion each year.&nbsp;</li><li>The Global Brand Counterfeiting Report, 2018 estimates that the amount of counterfeiting globally had reached <strong>$1.2</strong> Trillion by 2019 and that the losses suffered from online counterfeiting amounted to <strong>$323</strong> Billion in 2017 [7].</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">A summary of the legislation under consideration in the US and EU</h2>



<p>Recognizing the growing risk of consumer harm and economic loss posed by brand misuse online, lawmakers in the US and EU have tabled potential legislation aimed at helping brand owners secure greater protection for their products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following legislation directly pertains to e-commerce platforms and enforcing greater seller transparency.</p>



<h3 id="h-us-legislation">US Legislation&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>SHOP SAFE&nbsp;Act&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Shop Safe Act was a bi-partisan Bill introduced on 2 March 2020 with the aim of “<em>creating accountability to prevent hazardous items from infiltrating the homes of millions of Americans</em>”[8].&nbsp;The Bill is not currently before Congress for consideration, but it is widely expected to be re-introduced in some form.&nbsp;Its key features included:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>a codified&nbsp;set of ‘best practices’&nbsp;on screening sellers&nbsp;and tackling&nbsp;repeat offenders in return for liability&nbsp;protection;&nbsp;</li><li>a focus on&nbsp;goods with a health and safety component (goods which may give rise to&nbsp;illness/disease/injury/serious adverse events/allergic reactions or death);&nbsp;</li><li>application to&nbsp;any&nbsp;E-commerce&nbsp;platform&nbsp;which&nbsp;sells&nbsp;to US consumers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Trademark Modernization Act (“the TMA”)</strong></p>



<p>The TMA was enacted into law on 27 December 2020 with the aim of strengthening and improving the accuracy and integrity of the federal trademark register. Its key features include:</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>improving US Trade Mark Office registry process and procedures including measures to improve consumer protection (including codification of a rebuttable presumption of irreparable harm in the event of a Court finding there has been an infringement given the consumer protection concerns which would arise otherwise).</li></ul>



<p><strong>INFORM Consumers Act&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The INFORM Consumer Act will require online marketplaces to collect and authenticate basic seller information which sellers must also provide to consumers. Its key features include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>requiring online retail marketplaces which include third-party sellers of consumer products to authenticate the identity of “high-volume third-party sellers” through disclosure of seller information, government IDs, tax registration details, business address,&nbsp;telephone&nbsp;and email, etc.</li></ul>



<p><strong>SANTA Act&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The SANTA Act is another consumer protection orientated, bipartisan initiative focussed on transparency.&nbsp;Its key features include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>requiring marketplaces to display a seller’s full name, business address, telephone number and working email&nbsp;address;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>a requirement to notify buyers if the product shipped is supplied by a seller other than the one detailed in the product listing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-eu-legislation"><strong>EU Legislation&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><strong>The Digital Services Act&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>The Digital Services Act (the “DSA”), published by the European Commission on 15 December 2020, represents potentially the most sweeping reform to regulation of the internet economy in Europe in close to two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the Act’s remit will be improving transparency rules first introduced within Article 5 of the EU E-Commerce Directive (“ECD”). Under current rules, bad actors can still mask their identity and keep key details of their illicit online operations hidden.</p>



<p>A “Know Your Business Customer” (“KYBC”) principle will therefore be introduced in the upcoming DSA package. Hosting providers will not be allowed to provide services to business users who provide identity information that is invalid or false.</p>



<p>If the legislation is enacted, platforms will find themselves having to do much more to protect brands and consumers – and may face financial penalties if they do not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DSA includes:</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>A requirement that larger E-commerce platforms verify seller information to establish the&nbsp;true identity&nbsp;of the seller.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>A requirement for platforms to suspend for “a reasonable period of time” (and after having issued&nbsp;a prior warning), the provision of their services to recipients that frequently (repeatedly) provide manifestly illegal content. No guidance is given on what amounts to a “reasonable period of time.”&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Platforms need to play their part</h2>



<p>While legislation has a critical role to play, it can be a blunt tool and may not immediately remedy the issue.</p>



<p>We are calling on e-commerce marketplaces to proactively work with brands, lawmakers, and companies such as Incopro to improve the policies and processes they employ to tackle bad actors exploiting their platforms.</p>



<p>Together, we can harness mechanisms such as intelligence sharing and working groups to provide better protections for brands and consumers online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Businesses battled on many fronts in 2020, withstanding immense internal and external pressures while safeguarding consumers and brand value.</strong></p>



<p>New threats emerged throughout the year, and many of these are likely to prevail in 2021 and beyond.</p>



<p>This piece details the key emerging threats for brands to look out for in 2021 and sets out how to tackle them, with insights taken from a recent INSYNC roundtable discussion involving leading brands and industry experts.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-1-businesses-face-increasing-budgetary-and-resource-pressures"><strong>1. Businesses face increasing budgetary and resource pressures</strong></h2>



<p>Roundtable participants noted that they are expecting budget cuts in 2021, with the impact likely to be particularly felt by luxury and retail brands.</p>



<p>There has also been a substantial loss of legally qualified personnel from Brand Protection teams, as they have been needed to fulfil other legal work given the rise in disputes and contract changes.</p>



<p>Businesses will therefore have to ‘do more with less’ and make efficient use of available resources. Making the right decision about where to invest limited resources is key – many businesses are looking to online monitoring and enforcement over the traditional offline model.</p>



<p>Above all else, Brand Protection teams should focus on engaging with key decision makers in the wider business to make the case for the importance of Brand Protection, it’s application beyond the legal function, and the need for increased budget.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-2-shifting-from-offline-to-online">2. Shifting from offline to online</h2>



<p>Offline investigations and test purchases have become increasingly difficult with the restrictions placed on offices. This issue is compounded by law enforcement and investigators not being available due to lockdowns and other regional restrictions.</p>



<p>In order for law enforcement to be involved, there are threshold limits to seize products and make an impact. Participants also noted that when raids are possible, they are ineffective without verifiable intelligence.</p>



<p>Bad actors have been quick to capitalize on the opportunity posed by consumers moving online. This has meant businesses have had to reconsider their Brand Protection strategy and shift focus from offline to online. Online monitoring and cleaning of key digital channels is now more critical than ever to safeguard legitimate sales.</p>



<p>On a strategic level, brands should a greater focus on their key e-commerce channels and set out clear goals (e.g. keeping Amazon free of fakes). Teams should also consider selective targeting on key channels based upon the selling content, as opposed to just going for the big sellers.</p>



<p>Brands should also look to prevent bad actors from using display adverts and services such as Adwords to divert consumers to their fake websites. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Advanced keyword and image matching technology</a> is critical to achieving this.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-3-online-infringers-are-changing-behavior">3. Online infringers are changing behavior</h2>



<p>Participants agreed that there are now far more parties involved in brand misuse. Bad actors are now part of complex operations but often appear as isolated units, making enforcement more difficult.</p>



<p>It is critical, therefore, that brands are able to connect the dots between marketplaces, social media, e-commerce websites and other channels. Incopro’s <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/network-analysis/">Network Analysis technology</a> allows teams to uncover hidden online and offline connections between infringements to provide full visibility of the scale and complexity of the networks that undermine brands and harm consumers.</p>



<p>Bad actors are also becoming smarter at avoiding detection by Brand Protection teams while still remaining visible to consumers, using encrypted services such as WhatsApp and Telegram.</p>



<p>This is where the services of online investigators become extremely useful – they can embed themselves within groups on messaging apps to gather intelligence on the activity of bad actors, feeding this back to Brand Protection teams to take action.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-4-platforms-aren-t-playing-their-part">4. Platforms aren&#8217;t playing their part</h2>



<p>Participants stated that their teams are tracking any changes to legislation that pertains to platforms so that approved sellers &#8211; and not counterfeit sellers &#8211; are shown to users.</p>



<p>Some platforms have been slow to keep up with increasing volumes of infringement throughout the course of the pandemic, with delayed response times and terms of use not being strictly enforced.</p>



<p>However, there is still hope that platforms will take more proactive steps to protect consumers. Brands will have a key role to play and will need to be more open to sharing specific intelligence with platforms and other parties so that joint action can be taken and policies can be revised.</p>



<p>Participants also agreed that educational campaigns about counterfeiting issues and other forms of brand misuse, designed for consumers and business partners, are important and can be effective.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-see-further-roundtable-insights-from-insync" style="color:#009ca6">See further roundtable insights from INSYNC</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The recent suspensions of Trump’s social media profiles could have large ramifications for the Brand Protection community.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>While the US is no doubt experiencing tumultuous times, the banning of Donald Trump’s accounts has shown that large platforms can:</p>



<ul><li>1. Self-regulate, if there is incentive to do so</li><li>2. Ban users, completely and for life</li><li>3. Allow or not allow content (such as misinformation and fake news articles leading up to the election)</li></ul>



<p>It’s clear on both sides of the aisle that a question has been raised – how and why do platforms get to choose what content is allowed?</p>



<p>Now with greater scrutiny of the role of social media companies as ‘publishers’ rather than ‘platforms’, regulation of the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube is becoming increasingly likely.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Silicon Valley’s moves to eject President Trump from social media represent a display of power the companies have avoided making for nearly four years. Now Twitter Inc., Facebook Inc. and others must reckon with what comes next […] The actions against Mr. Trump and Parler illustrate more starkly than ever the companies’ influence over conversation online […]&#8221;</p><cite>The Washington Post (Jan 10, 2021) [1]</cite></blockquote>



<p>If the tech giants have the capability and willingness to ban Trump for inciting violence, why not counterfeit products? Why not illicit medicines sold through illegitimate channels? Why not items prohibited by the platforms’ own policies?</p>



<p>There is a clear shift in platforms’ policy, with the actions against Trump and Parler (an ‘alt-tech’ microblogging and social networking service) likely to push the US government to act on the significant influence these handful of companies have online. Incopro believes it is critical that legislative action extends to mandating penalties for facilitating the sales of dangerous/illegal products after receiving notice of infringement.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Platforms have shown that they are willing to monitor and action the content they host; now they need to do it in the name of consumer protection.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The Lanham Act</strong>,<strong> current legislation that governs the use of trademarks in the US, was first adopted in 1947 and is therefore ill-equipped to effectively protect brand owners as they promote their products using new technologies and platforms.</strong></p>



<p>The issue has been brought to the limelight by hashtag-related trademark abuse on social media, with platforms often reluctant to remove content on this basis.</p>



<p>Collaboration between platforms, law makers, and Brand Protection experts is critical to bring IP legislation in line with the rapidly moving online environment and to balance the many conflicting rights and interests.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-the-current-legal-environment">The current legal environment</h2>



<p>Observing that a majority of U.S based social media companies utilize hashtags, which may contain trademarks, it is necessary to delve into the <strong>Lanham Act </strong>[1] which regulates trademark related matters. A trademark is comprised of three cumulative different elements:</p>



<ul><li>A distinctive name, which may comprise of words, symbols, image or in some rare occasions, even scents and sounds;</li><li>That is used to identify the source of goods or services by distinguishing them from other parties;</li><li>And is used for commercial purposes.</li></ul>



<p>By registering a trademark, a party gains its exclusive use in the general commerce, being able to not only trade under it, but also license it and ward off any potential parties attempting to infringe it.</p>



<p>In practice, since the late 2000s, the use of the hashtag to cross-refer to a specific content or theme has been rising substantially on social media platforms as it allowed a significant reduction of marketing costs, strengthened consumers’ loyalty and easily attracted new ones. It is no surprise that such use was quickly seen as an efficient way to advertise and promote brands online [2]. This led to an increase of trademark applications for hashtags. One example would be the case of Coca Cola Company who had previously registered the trademark for “#cokecanpics” [3].</p>



<p>But is the use of the metadata tag &#8211; the hashtag keyword referring to a registered trademark in the present case &#8211; always lawful on social media?</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-trademark-infringement-through-hashtag-abuse">Trademark infringement through hashtag abuse</h2>



<p>If a hashtag includes a trademark that has been registered or suggests a connection with this trademark or the trademark owner in a way that is likely to misuse consumers, there may be a ground for trademark abuse [4]. In particular, an infringement seems to be established when the likelihood of confusion and association is linked to the advertisement of competing brands or goods and services that are very similar to the ones the registered trademark distinguishes [5].</p>



<p>Indeed, in the 2015 case <em>Fraternity Collection v Fargnoli</em>, a former employee of the plaintiff began utilizing hashtags such as “#FratCollection” and “#FraternityCollection” to advertise fashion designs belonging to the defendant. While the parties both moved to dismiss the case, the judge refused the dismissal and mention that ““hashtagging a competitor’s name or product in social media posts could, in certain circumstances, deceive consumers”[6].</p>



<p>Even though the case was eventually settled by the parties and dismissed subsequently, it highlights the following argument: using well-known trademarks or trademarks’ reputation and goodwill in hashtags in order to advertise one’s own goods and services to make profit via an increased traffic on their online content can be fraudulent and seen as unfair competition.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, social media platforms tend to be reluctant to remove content on the ground of “hashtag &#8211; related trademark abuse”. Indeed, the confusion as to the origin, connection or sponsorship of the goods and services can be tricky to establish. Platforms are most likely to find that the use of trademarks in hashtags identifies and comments on goods and services rather than constitutes a violation of intellectual property rights, following a reasoning that is similar to the one for <em>Eksouzian v. Albanese</em> [7]&nbsp; which holds that “hashtags are merely descriptive devices, not trademarks, unitary or otherwise, in and of themselves” which are “used to direct consumers to the location of the promotion”[8].</p>



<p>Moreover, it is worth mentioning that trademark owners will see their trademarks used as a hashtag on predominant social media platforms, even in posts unrelated to their products and that another limitation to trademark enforcement in that case is the notion of Fair Use. While not delving in detail into the notions of fair use, one fact is necessary to bring to the spotlight: If the use of the hashtag is of non-commercial use (i.e. a product review) then we would be in the presence of fair use.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-the-need-for-modernized-ip-legislation">The need for modernized IP legislation</h2>



<p>These trends on social media could suggest that hashtags, which have become essential social media instruments reflecting “a culture of sharing and openness, and “real-time” marketing” [9] are not compatible with the current intellectual property laws.</p>



<p>Trademark Law around hashtags undoubtedly remains until this day quite a grey area and further communication and exchanges between platforms, intellectual property law makers, lawyers and brand protection experts appear necessary to redefine the notion of trademark which is perpetually evolving in the digital era and to put in balance conflicting rights and interests.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>In good news for brand owners, 2020 holiday spending reached an eye watering $100 billion by December in the US alone [1]. However, e-commerce events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday continue to be targeted by copycats, impersonators and counterfeiters who exploit spikes in consumer demand.</strong></p>



<p>These sales figures should be understood as part of a trend; e-commerce growth continues at rapid pace, with brick-and-mortar footfall decimated by the ongoing effects of COVID-19. In 2020, e-commerce tore up previous predictions and grew by <strong>30%</strong> in the US[2]. This is a new high for online sales, and a level not previously predicted until 2022.</p>



<p>In this piece, we detail our findings on brand exploitation during Black Friday 2020 and illustrate why a comprehensive Brand Protection strategy is needed to ensure your business can succeed as the world rapidly shifts online.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Brand exploiter behavior during Black Friday</h2>



<p>Brand exploiters hide their fake products among genuine discounted goods and are therefore able to mask low pricing that would usually raise eyebrows. Even to the savviest of consumers, counterfeits become difficult to identify within a sea of constantly changing offers and flash-sales.</p>



<p>With <strong>55%</strong> of consumers begin their online shopping searches on Amazon’s site [3] – brand owners are immediately put at a disadvantage by brand exploiters operating on marketplaces during sale events.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Black Friday 2020: Rampant brand exploitation on large e-commerce platforms</h2>



<p>The holidays are a particularly prolific time for brand exploiters. With 2020&#8217;s record-high online shopping volumes, counterfeit listings and sales are spiking. For example, in the week of Thanksgiving / run up to Black Friday / Cyber Monday 2020, compared to a week 3 months back, Incopro’s technology detected:</p>



<ul><li><strong>443%</strong> growth of high-risk listings on Amazon for a consumer electronics brand</li><li><strong>155%</strong> growth of high-risk listings on eBay for a watch/jewelry retailer</li><li><strong>121%</strong> increase in high-risk listings on Amazon for a luxury brand</li><li><strong>51%</strong> increase in high-risk listings on Amazon for a streetwear brand</li></ul>



<h3>Percentage growth of infringement on Amazon &amp; eBay in the run up to December</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>19th-26th August</td><td>19th-26th November</td><td>Growth</td><td>Platform</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer electronics</td><td>228</td><td>1239</td><td>443%</td><td>Amazon</td></tr><tr><td>Watch brand</td><td>442</td><td>1125</td><td>155%</td><td>Ebay</td></tr><tr><td>Luxury brand</td><td>206</td><td>455</td><td>121%</td><td>Amazon</td></tr><tr><td>Streetwear brand</td><td>360</td><td>543</td><td>51%</td><td>Amazon</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Why platforms need to do more</h2>



<p>Many platforms have measures in place to facilitate the removal of brand exploiters. However, these tools offer varied results and do not provide enough coverage to make a lasting impact.</p>



<h3 id="h-amazon-brand-registry-not-providing-peace-of-mind-to-brands">Amazon – Brand Registry not providing peace of mind to brands</h3>



<p>The platform’s Brand Protection program “Brand Registry” is characterized by slow and inadequate responses to brand exploitation. Inconsistencies in the processing time for similar or identical violations also create a headache for brand owners. This means cases often need to be escalated – this additional step is burdensome and far more inconsistent than the initial reporting process.<br><br>Furthermore, Amazon often prevents brand owners from reporting violations if the rate of successful enforcement is deemed too low, and subsequently demand that a test purchase is conducted as evidence.</p>



<h3 id="h-ebay-inconsistent-responses-to-enforcement-and-declining-compliance">eBay – Inconsistent responses to enforcement and declining compliance</h3>



<p>eBay too suffers from inconsistent and slow responses to enforcement. It has also recently shown a decline in overall compliance. Practices towards similar or identical reported listings vary enormously across territories. And to add further frustration, explanations for notice rejections are frequently inconsistent, incorrect, or missing altogether, requiring multiple follow-ups.</p>



<p>Such issues extend to notices regarding breaches of the platform’s own policy, which covers soon-to-expire and expired products or products missing expiry dates, particularly in relation to medication, foodstuffs, and other consumable goods.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-can-brands-do">What can brands do?</h2>



<p>It is essential that brands monitor brand exploitation trends in the run-up to Black Friday. For each high-priority platform, you should have a comprehensive strategy in place. Our proposed strategy for Amazon during the holiday season is as follows:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Monitor the buy box on your listings closely (up to 82% of all Amazon sales go through the buy box [4])</li><li>Proactively defend your brand on Amazon by signing up to Brand Registry and ‘gate’ high-priority ASINs (the ASIN is the unique offer identifier on Amazon &#8211; it poses difficulty to brand owners because Amazon requires all listings for a single product to be located on the same ASIN page)</li><li>Monitor non-gated authorized ASINs and look for duplicates</li></ol>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Amazon’s Brand Registry</strong>&nbsp;offers tools to help brands manage their presence on the marketplace and to remove infringing products, including:</p>



<ul><li>Bulk enforcement of counterfeit ASINs</li><li>Merging duplicate ASINs</li></ul>



<p><strong><br>ASIN gating</strong>&nbsp;refers to the practice of ‘locking’ authorized ASINs so that only a select list of verified sellers can operate on it. Brands should be aware that it is only available to those enrolled in the Brand Registry. It is a paid service and is reserved for a select number of your listings.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-comprehensive-year-round-strategy">A comprehensive year-round strategy</h3>



<p>Earlier, we mentioned that growth in e-commerce is not isolated to sales event but is part of a long-term trend that has been accelerated by COVID-19. In a post-pandemic world, you’ll need a comprehensive strategy that protects your consumers and revenue streams online.</p>



<p>Noting the limitations of platforms tools, collaboration with platforms is still core to building this strategy. Where&nbsp;your consumers shop and&nbsp;who&nbsp;they purchase from are important considerations when choosing the platforms that you prioritize and develop robust relationships with.</p>



<p>Once you’ve decided the key platforms in which to focus your efforts, you should seek to engage with them directly or through a trusted partner. The following approach should be considered as part of your relationship building exercise:</p>



<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts within the platforms’ support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;</li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;</li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;and interact with the relevant representatives where the platform has local websites</li></ul>



<p>As alluded to, there is only so much you can achieve without a technology solution. A critical component of a comprehensive strategy is sophisticated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectiontechnology">Brand Protection technology</a>&nbsp;that works in tandem with platform tools but also:</p>



<ul><li>Collects more data on the individuals exploiting your brand</li><li>Prioritizes high-risk listings that your consumers are most likely to find</li><li>Makes the connection between brand exploiters operating across multiple channels and regions</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Brand Protection technology is critical</h2>



<p>Talisman, Incopro’s Brand Protection platform, is a complete tool that ensures that businesses have all the data they need related to brand exploitation, including the risk posed by infringing listings and a view of the networks of criminals targeting their brands. Once gathered, Talisman provides the means for seamless enforcement against brand exploiters.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Counterfeit white goods can be found easily through search engines, putting consumer health and safety at grave risk.</h2>



<p>Incopro research reveals that websites offering these potentially dangerous counterfeits goods are often found on search engines, and brands currently have no easy means of having these indexed results removed.</p>



<p>Incopro is calling for search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yandex to do more to safeguard consumers from fakes before more stringent regulation is required.</p>



<h3>The dangers of counterfeit white goods</h3>



<p>Counterfeit parts can cause irreparable damage to expensive appliances. Even worse, appliance failure potentially can lead to electrical fires and&nbsp;deadly gas&nbsp;leaks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When making a purchase of white goods, consumers tend to rely on trusted brands and traditional supply chains &#8211; the complexity of these appliances makes it more difficult for infringers to fool consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The costs involved with manufacturing and distributing finished counterfeit appliances also creates a barrier to entry for bad actors.</p>



<p>However, it is replacement parts where the issue lies. Disreputable suppliers seek to fool cost-conscious consumers who search online for cheap replacement parts to extend the life of their white goods.</p>



<p>Fake replacement refrigerator parts such as water filters pose a danger to consumers, who rely on them to filter out contaminants &#8211; counterfeits are not up to this vital&nbsp;task.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Online sales of counterfeit refrigerator water filters are a rapidly growing problem. These counterfeit water filters are sold with misleading and fraudulent labelling, often including illegal use of brand names, logos, and product labels,”</em></p><cite>the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) warns in an online public awareness campaign(1).<br>&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p>The group’s independent tests of counterfeit water filters purchased from websites demonstrate the alarming dangers that consumers face from a mistaken purchase:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“[1] Counterfeit filters failed to remove harmful lead from household water. [2] Counterfeit filters failed to remove live cysts from household water. [3] Some counterfeit filters introduced harmful compounds into household water.”</em></p></blockquote>



<h3>The availability of fake replacement parts through search</h3>



<p>One counterfeit website identified by Incopro was ‘refrigerator-water-filters.com’. The website listed four brands (Whirlpool, Samsung, Kenmore and GE) in its page title to deliberately cause consumer confusion and helped it to appear in search engine results when consumers searched for those brands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All consumers arrived at this website via organic search. The top 5 keywords used to find the website were associated with genuine refrigerator water filter models: 69625-ct-001, aprilaire ffc20256sg, idylis es 12-id, ph21210 whir, and kohler k20852-na.35<sup>[2]</sup><br></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="363" height="214" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6532" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.png 363w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>When conducting a search using these search terms on Google.com, ‘refrigerator-water-filters.com’ appeared on&nbsp;the first page of results in 4 out of 5 searches.</p>



<p>Refrigerator-water-filters.com offered a variety of counterfeit brand name and fake replacement water filters that were likely neither safe nor actually compatible with the refrigerators. For example, it offered a filter that it described as a “Whirlpool EDR1RXD1” and another that was described as a “Maytag Puriclean III” alongside pictures of packaging and product that contained brand name logos. The AHAM research suggests that these water filters did not meet consumer water filtration safety standards, potentially exposing unsuspecting consumers to contaminants.</p>



<p>The ‘About Us’ section of the Refrigerator-water-filters.com website noted that the company was headquartered in China where “production and product development takes place”. From there, the products were shipped worldwide. Even though it claimed to produce and develop its own filters, it also falsely claimed that branded items were “original”.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="425" height="35" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6534" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-1.png 425w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-1-300x25.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left heading-branded bg-grey--light">Search Engines: Time to step up</h2>



<p>Concern about consumer safety should extend beyond brands and industry groups, as fake replacement parts continue to pose a clear and present danger. A concerted, joint effort is needed to protect consumers, with search engines at the forefront.</p>



<p>Brands are often powerless to act alone, as rogue counterfeit-supporting web hosts are uncooperative with website takedown requests.</p>



<p>Incopro calls for search engines such as Google to work with brands to establish a swift process to have counterfeit sites removed from results.</p>

<h2>According to new Incopro research, up to <strong>3 in 9</strong> first-page search results for branded baby teethers are for websites selling harmful or counterfeit products, posing danger to young children.</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Childrens-products_3-in-9-search-results-harmful_positive_RGB1.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>As total toy sales have slumped in the wake of the demise of US retail giant Toys “R” Us, ecommerce sales have been on the rise, representing a tectonic shift in the toy landscape.</p>



<p>Consumers now purchase toys from a wide array of relatively unknown online retailers, instead of trusted and well-established offline stores. They also purchase from marketplaces such as Amazon which, despite being widely regarded by consumers as a trustworthy platform, is known to contain thousands of counterfeit products.</p>



<p>Worryingly, consumers are increasingly being exposed to counterfeit toys and baby products on search engines in the run-up to seasonal events such as Black Friday and Christmas. Poorly-constructed fakes such as baby teethers have even been found to be available on popular marketplaces, putting young children at risk of choking.</p>



<p>A Senate Finance Committee staff report published on November 7 calls for U.S Customs and Border Protection to be able to share more information on counterfeits with private sector firms such as ecommerce platforms, but search engines themselves have a greater role to play in fighting online counterfeiting.</p>



<h3>The dangers of fake children’s products</h3>



<p>Toy brands abide by stringent regulation on materials and methods of manufacturing – and adhere to stricter regulation still for baby products. All items sold must also include detailed warnings and instructions to ensure their proper use.</p>



<p>Counterfeiters, on the other hand, care little about child safety and produce toys in unsanitary and unregulated environments, using poor-quality or even toxic parts.</p>



<p>Last December, it was reported that a 4-year-old child in the US was rushed to hospital after swallowing 13 tiny magnets exposed when a counterfeit toy broke apart <sup>[1]</sup>. The internal infection that spread as a result meant the child had to have parts of their colon and intestines removed, leaving them permanently scarred.</p>



<p>News publications initially identified the toy as ‘Magformers’, a magnetic construction set sold by a US firm. According to Inc.com, it was only after further investigation that it was revealed the product was a counterfeit produced by a Chinese company and, disturbingly, was widely available on marketplaces.</p>



<h3>Notorious online marketplaces found in search results</h3>



<p>Fake children’s products such as baby teethers are appearing at the top of search results and are readily available to consumers.</p>



<p>Incopro&#8217;s research reveals that searches for teethers contain a number of online marketplace listings – many of which offer fake or unsafe products. Of the first 10 results that would be displayed to a consumer, 32.5% directed to online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and ‘DHGate’. Of these, 65.4% appeared within the first five results on the page.</p>



<p>The chart below shows research on the volume of traffic that is directed via search engines to some of the largest global marketplaces that are gripped by counterfeiting.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Percentage-of-marketplace-traffic-from-organic-search_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>More than 50% of the traffic going to the notorious marketplaces ‘Prom’ (based in Ukraine), ‘Made-in-China’ and ‘DHGate’ (both based in China) is through organic search.</p></blockquote>



<p>Consumers finding and purchasing low-priced fakes on marketplaces outside of their home country is alarming. Many of these results are displayed when consumers search for branded toys and are designed to deceive them into thinking they are genuine.</p>



<h3>Searches for wholesale Comotomo teethers contain counterfeits</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Wholesale-Comotomo-teether_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>A keyword search on Google.com for “wholesale comotomo teether” presented nine organic search results, each of which directed to a marketplace or ecommerce site. Of the nine organic search results, three were for potentially harmful products that misused the Comotomo trademark (highlighted in red).<br><br><em>Screenshot: A keyword search on Google.com for “wholesale comotomo teether” (Incopro, 2019). Note: The first result is a paid advertisement</em></p>



<p>The second organic result is a link to a category page on Alibaba and not a specific product, making it more challenging to get the marketplace to take action.</p>



<p>The presence of the brand name confuses the consumer &#8211; the page lists products that are the same or similar to the Comotomo products but are sold at a fraction of the price and are potentially harmful.</p>



<p>The search result also uses metadata supplied by Alibaba as seen below. The impression given to the consumer is that they will be landing on a page with 150 Comotomo products &#8211; this is not the case.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba-category-metadata-Comotomo-Baby-Suppliers_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p><em>Screenshot: Metadata on Alibaba category page for ‘Comotomo Baby Suppliers’ (Incopro, 2019). </em></p>



<p>Below the Alibaba search result is an example of another type of wholesale supplier. ‘ywhgifts.com’ sells a wide variety of counterfeits, from teething toys to baby applicators and cell phone cases. This site continues to receive a huge share of traffic from organic search (76.89% over the past year) despite its status.</p>



<p>Brand names for these products are prominently displayed in these results, leading to confusion that these products are produced by Comotomo when several are not.</p>



<h2>Search engines must do more</h2>



<p>Brands can demand fake products be taken down from marketplaces, but this is of little practical use &#8211; it would not deal with the results pages hosted on these sites that are deceiving consumers.</p>



<p>Search engines, instead, need to get ahead of the game and provide a technology-based solution to tackle counterfeits. In doing so, they can demonstrate their willingness to proactively engage in wider anti-counterfeiting efforts alongside the government and ecommerce platforms and protect children from serious harm.</p>



<p>If they sit back and refuse, case law that extends liability to search engines for harmful counterfeits may come calling.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>According to new Incopro research, up to 60% of the first-page results for the search query ‘buy Bactrim online’ (a branded antibiotic) are for sites selling counterfeit or unsafe products.</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pharma_6-in-10-search-results-unlawful_-positive_RGB_V2-1024x394.png" alt="" width="400" height="154" /></p>
<p>Fake pharmaceuticals are on the rise and are readily available online, with Search Engines pivotal in directing users to infringing locations. To uncover the scale of the issue, Incopro has undertaken new research into the role Search Engines play in serving counterfeit and other illegal content to unwitting consumers.</p>
<p>Search Engines are enabling illegal online pharmacies to flourish, and this puts consumers at great risk. Search engines should provide a scalable solution to help brands remove illegal online pharmacies from their index.</p>
<h2>The dangers of fake pharmaceuticals</h2>
<p>Consumers exposed to fake medications are put at severe risk. Counterfeits leave health issues untreated and may, in fact, make them worse by building pathogen resistance against an active ingredient found in the genuine drug. Consumers given the wrong dosages can also be susceptible to adverse side effects. In some cases, counterfeiters even add dangerous or toxic substances to their products to achieve a ‘desired’ side-effect to give them the aura of authenticity.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/One-third-of-medicines-are-fake_RGB.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>According to pharmaceutical company Bayer other examples of counterfeited drugs include[1]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products with manipulated expiration dates</li>
<li>Products containing no active agents (rendering the medicine useless)</li>
<li>­­Products wrapped in forged packaging</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding counterfeits through search</h3>
<p>Search Engines play a direct role in enabling illicit trade, with consumers fooled by the faux legitimacy given to locations found at the top of search queries. Alarmingly, consumers most often reach counterfeit locations through organic search queries, rather than direct links.</p>
<p>Incopro research reveals that, on average, over 58% of traffic for infringing pharmaceutical websites originates from organic search. Over 47% of traffic to these infringing locations comes from keywords that specify a brand or a particular product. This echoes a study by IFOP, a leading international polling and market research firm, that highlights that 47% of people who had bought an infringing product typed the name of the product into a Search Engine before making a purchase.</p>
<p>For pharmaceuticals, our research found that total traffic from product or brand keywords is 60%, indicating that consumers look for specific drugs when using search and are likely being unknowingly misdirected to infringing sites.</p>
<h4>Counterfeits appearing at the top of search results</h4>
<p>The problem is exacerbated by fraudulent websites appearing at the top of search results for popular queries. According to a 2017 study by one of the world’s largest telecommunications groups, Optify, the first result shown on a search query will receive over 44% of all “click-throughs”[2].</p>
<p>After an update to Google’s search algorithm in August 2018, dubbed ‘Medic’[3], commentators began suggesting that the platform may be inadvertently favoring fraudulent websites[4]. The update, while reportedly not aimed at the medical and health space, had the greatest impact on sites within this sector and, as with all previous core algorithm changes, was designed to “benefit pages that were previously under-rewarded”.</p>
<p>For the five sectors investigated in this study, more than 26% of potentially harmful sites appeared within the first three search results.</p>
<h4>Brand names and trademarks used within domains</h4>
<p>Those results appearing in the top spots were more likely to have a brand name in the domain name itself, indicating that search algorithms may, in fact, be favoring illicit locations that hijack trademarks for SEO.</p>
<p>Applying Incopro’s visibility score, our data-science-led method of indicating how visible an infringement is to consumers, we discovered that over 27% of potentially harmful websites had a visibility score of 10 or above, meaning that there was a high chance of being found by users. The analysis found that brand names and product-specific keywords were, again, prevalent in the domain names of these websites.</p>
<p>The screenshot below is the search results on Google.com for the term ‘buy Bactrim online’. Potentially harmful sites are highlighted in red, lawful sites in yellow, and “information only” websites in blue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Buy-Bactrim-Online-Google-Search-596x1024.png" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Screenshot taken on 07/05/2019: Search results on Google.com for the term ‘buy Bactrim online’ (Incopro, 2019)</em></p>
<p>60% of the results above were identified as potentially harmful. A “potentially harmful site” will typically use a third-party registered trademark without permission and fraudulently claim to be accredited by regulatory bodies[5].</p>
<p>By combining the highly conservative conversion rate of 2.5%[6] and the average traffic coming from organic search, we estimate that an infringing pharmaceutical site will sell to 642 users a month.</p>
<p>With this issue now reaching a critical state; we believe Search Engines can do more to stop it.</p>
<h3>An opportunity to protect consumers</h3>
<p>Google’s dominance is clear, holding 92.42% of the global market share today. But it is important to note that Search Engines such as Baidu, in China, and Yandex, in Russia, have a stronghold of their domestic markets (66.89% and 49.13% respectively).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Search-Engine-market-share-1024x350.png" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Search Engine market share (Incopro, 2019)</em></p>
<p>The FDA and other government bodies have limited resources and cannot solve the issue alone. Brand owners should be able to seek remedies for themselves and alert platforms to infringement.</p>
<p>However, the issue needs to be approached at a sector level if it is to be effectively solved; online infringers are adept at switching tactics when one source of traffic and revenue is shut off.</p>
<p>By taking the lead, Search Engines can together set the standard for protecting consumers online.</p>
