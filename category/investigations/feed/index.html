<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The business models and tactics deployed to hijack businesses&#8217; digital channels have become increasingly sophisticated – it’s critical that your team is equipped with the tools and knowledge to remain one step ahead.</strong></p>



<p>In a poll of Brand Protection professionals <strong>69%</strong> stated that when planning their strategy, they either haven’t considered the business models of bad actors or find it hard to understand / get visibility of them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="414" height="268" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Poll-results-Planning-Brand-Protection-strategy-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11719" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Poll-results-Planning-Brand-Protection-strategy-1.png 414w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Poll-results-Planning-Brand-Protection-strategy-1-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></figure>



<p>By building an understanding of bad actors&#8217; operating models and uncovering their online networks, brands can maintain consumer trust and maximize the opportunity offered by&nbsp;e-commerce.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" style="color:#009ca6">Part 1:&nbsp;The threats posed by bad actors online to your business and its consumers</h2>



<p>The business models deployed by bad actors most often mimic those of legitimate businesses.&nbsp;Bad actors will also often share the same strategic considerations when they go to market and promote products, utilizing the same digital channels and tools.</p>



<p>The changing online and commercial environment changes the way they adapt, like any business.&nbsp;This is also true when enforcement activity changes their behavior.</p>



<h3 id="h-seasonal-trend-and-enforcement-based-changes-in-bad-actors-behavior">Seasonal, trend, and enforcement-based changes in bad actors’ behavior</h3>



<p>Bad actors’ behavior is constantly changing in response to events that can impact their sales and ability to operate.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“Changes&nbsp;I commonly observe&nbsp;can be&nbsp;based on similar things to legitimate business: seasons/holidays/trends in the social environment. Bad actors also&nbsp;change as a reaction to&nbsp;enforcement.”</strong></p><cite>Alex Shad, Brand Protection Team Lead, Incopro</cite></blockquote>



<p>With Seasonal events such as Easter, Halloween, and Christmas, bad actors will emulate genuine brand behavior&nbsp;on social media, marketplaces, and websites. With cases of phishing, fraud, and impersonation, bad actors attempt to make their social posts and websites appear genuine to trick consumers. They will also combine this with the use of redirects and other entities that look legitimate to divert consumers.</p>



<p>Bad actors will also react to the social climate. For example, they started producing face masks&nbsp;during the coronavirus pandemic – as seen <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/how-agile-infringer-networks-restructure-and-avoid-enforcement/">in this network example</a>.</p>



<p>Enforcement is also a key driver, with behavior depending on issue type:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fraud/impersonation</strong> – enforcement is more likely to&nbsp;scare bad actors into hiding. They will depopulate&nbsp;enforceable pages and then repopulate&nbsp;very quickly without notice&nbsp;to disseminate scams. They may also set up personal profiles to later populate if they are expecting enforcement on pages that are currently live.</li><li><strong>Traditional trademark infringement</strong> – After enforcement, bad actors&nbsp;are more likely to change the way in which they infringe as opposed to changing their business model. The seller may blur over the infringing elements&nbsp;of images or&nbsp;appear to cease the sale of certain products.</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-bad-actors-are-often-agile-operators-that-adopt-emerging-platforms"><strong>Bad actors are often agile operators that adopt emerging platforms</strong></h3>



<p>Bad actors can be more dynamic than legitimate businesses at entering new markets and deploying new technology as they have lower barriers to entry. Counterfeiters, in particular, make use of new emerging platforms and have used influencer culture to their advantage.</p>



<p>TikTok, a user-generated content (UGC) platform that has enjoyed huge growth over the last year, is a good example – it has seen over 2 billion downloads in it’s first 4 years since launch, with Q1 2020 seeing over 315m&nbsp;downloads alone. TikTok’s primary audience is younger consumers, who are quicker to adopt newer media formats. Bad actors have latched onto this platform and often use influencers, who lend an aura of authenticity, to promote their goods to large swathes of consumers.</p>



<h3 id="h-bad-actors-are-one-step-ahead-in-reacting-to-market-trends">Bad actors are one step ahead in reacting to market trends</h3>



<p>Bad actors will also often be one step ahead of legitimate companies in reacting to market trends. An example of this is product unboxing videos – bad actors sometimes enlist the help of prominent influencers on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube to unbox their counterfeit products, highlighting key features and build quality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="650" height="427" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Example-of-counterfeit-unboxing-on-YouTube.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11723" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Example-of-counterfeit-unboxing-on-YouTube.jpg 650w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Example-of-counterfeit-unboxing-on-YouTube-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure>



<p>When reacting to wider market trends, they do not adhere to rules, regulations, or legal frameworks, meaning they can create and market new product lines far faster than legitimate companies.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" style="color:#009ca6">Part 2:&nbsp;The models used to capture consumers, and how to disrupt them&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We will look at 3 different types of network to illustrate how&nbsp;they are structured and how you can tackle them:&nbsp;</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Simple network: marketplace seller connected by WeChat&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Traditional counterfeiting&nbsp;network&nbsp;selling luxury watches</li><li>Multichannel network selling flavored vaping liquids&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h3 id="h-1-simple-network-shopee-storefronts-seller-connected-by-wechat">1. Simple network – Shopee storefronts seller connected by WeChat</h3>



<p>In this example, Incopro analysts discovered a network selling counterfeit goods that pose a health risk to consumers.</p>



<p><strong>Key features of the network:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Marketplace seller found to be offering infringing items which posed a health risk to consumers</li><li>WeChat ID connected the account to 32 other storefronts on the same platform</li><li>Auditing these connected storefronts could reveal further issues for the brand</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="366" height="335" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11730" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-1.png 366w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-1-300x275.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></figure>



<p>The network is comprised of multiple&nbsp;Shopee storefronts all connected by one single WeChat account&nbsp;– without using <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/whiteboard/network-analysis/">Network Analysis technology</a>, these storefronts would have been encountered one by one without&nbsp;the&nbsp;link ever being made,&nbsp;removing the possibility for&nbsp;coordinated enforcement causing max disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using this link, Incopro analysts can search and ‘audit’ each linked storefront and screen&nbsp;these for similar infringements or references to the relevant brands.&nbsp;If other infringements are found, these can be collected for enforcement as one notice through the Shopee webform.&nbsp;An additional benefit of&nbsp;coordinated enforcement on individual sellers is the increased chance the platform would proactively deactivate the whole storefront.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-large-scale-network-selling-counterfeit-luxury-watch-network">2. Large-scale network selling counterfeit luxury watch network</h3>



<p>In this example, Incopro discovered a typical counterfeiting network offering luxury watches predominantly via websites. The network was multinational in nature,&nbsp;with a global supply chain which centered on China.</p>



<p><strong>Key features of the network:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Large scale network containing 216 websites connected by 8 common email addresses (3 China-based and 5 international)</li><li>These networks primarily use traditional search methods to attract traffic&nbsp;</li><li>Targeted multiple brands owned by a number of different businesses, indicating a broad network (other brands targeted: Rolex, Breitling, Timberland, UGG)</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="378" height="370" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11726" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-2.png 378w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-2-300x294.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></figure>



<p>Coordinated action against all of the entities within the network is one method to effectively disrupt&nbsp;its operation. With most of the network’s customers arriving via organic search, Google’s URL delisting tool could also come in to play to starve the network of its traffic source. Equally, due to the large scale of the network, offline action with legal partners would also be an effective strategy to tackle the perpetrators.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-multichannel-network-selling-vaping-products">3. Multichannel Network&nbsp;selling vaping products </h3>



<p>In this example, vaping liquid products were sold via websites and marketplaces with promotional pages on social media.</p>



<p><strong>Key features of the network:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Complex network with multiple storefronts and websites</li><li>Domains&nbsp;connected by&nbsp;a&nbsp;company&nbsp;that supports website &amp; online store set up and synchronization</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="399" height="284" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11732" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-3.png 399w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-3-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></figure>



<p>Connections made by Network Analysis technology allow for all marketplace listings, social media posts, and domain URLs to be enforced at once, leaving the bad actor with no opportunity to change product listings. The Domains&nbsp;that are connected by&nbsp;the website set-up company&nbsp;can then be forwarded to the Investigations Services team to build further intelligence.</p>



<h3 id="h-incopro-case-study-offline-action-disrupting-counterfeit-jewelry-network-in-china">Incopro Case Study: Offline action disrupting counterfeit jewelry network in China</h3>



<p>One core avenue to dismantling bad actor networks is coordinated offline action in liaison with local authorities and law enforcement agencies.</p>



<p>In 2018, a counterfeiting&nbsp;ring that peddled high-value&nbsp;jewelry&nbsp;(average&nbsp;price $8,000) across popular online marketplaces was discovered by Incopro’s analysts. Test-purchases&nbsp;were used to gather identifying information on the perpetrators, with the wider case being built using&nbsp;data gathered from Taobao, Weibo, and WeChat. Subsequent offline action led to over 50&nbsp;arrests and seizure of products across seven&nbsp;addresses.</p>



<p>Multilateral action is key&nbsp;to more effective offline action. In China, the close relationship between CBBC (China Britain Business Council) and platforms such as Alibaba now make offline investigations easier to undertake.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" style="color:#009ca6">Part 3:&nbsp;How Network Analysis technology can help you address these threats effectively&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/network-analysis/">Network Analysis</a> is a core module of Incopro’s Brand Protection platform <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Talisman</a> that powers a strategic approach to tackling networks.&nbsp;By connecting infringing entities across channels such as websites, marketplaces, and social media – and matching them against online and offline identifiers – Network Analysis gives you full visibility of the risks to your brands, prioritizes them by threat level, and provides you with the insights to act on them at scale.</p>



<p><strong>There are four key components to Incopro’s Network Analysis technology that enable you to tackle the most damaging threats to your business:</strong></p>



<h4 id="h-1-good-quality-data-meaningful-networks">1. GOOD QUALITY DATA = MEANINGFUL NETWORKS</h4>



<ul><li>Processes for cleaning and validating data before networks are built</li><li>Algorithms to make networks more meaningful, e.g. take out nodes with too many links</li><li>All useful data points extracted, both structured and unstructured</li><li>Inferred links based on similarities – helps uncover potentially connected nodes</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-2-contextualized-threats-in-the-universe-of-networks">2. CONTEXTUALIZED THREATS IN THE ‘UNIVERSE’ OF NETWORKS</h4>



<ul><li>Threat score to prioritize and assess each network</li><li>Take into account popularity, action taken and the risk from the network’s component parts</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-3-tools-to-search-manipulate-and-edit">3. TOOLS TO SEARCH, MANIPULATE AND EDIT</h4>



<ul><li>Search and filter clusters on a wide variety of data points</li><li>Compare networks to understand the bigger picture</li><li>Add and remove nodes and links to build out your online and offline intelligence picture</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-4-impactful-enforcement-from-the-network-view">4. IMPACTFUL ENFORCEMENT FROM THE NETWORK VIEW</h4>



<ul><li>Identify key enablers to dismantle all or part of the network, as your strategy directs</li><li>Tackle the whole network and see how it responds&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-when-to-use-network-analysis-within-your-workflow">When to use Network Analysis within your workflow</h3>



<p>The tool&nbsp;has the potential to be used&nbsp;as both&nbsp;a&nbsp;principal&nbsp;resource for online action and a supplementary&nbsp;resource for further enforcement.&nbsp;Brand owners can filter through high-risk networks&nbsp;and networks that include tagged objects.&nbsp;This includes checking connections made with official entities.</p>



<p>Brand owners can then screen, tag and enforce infringements outside of the tool&nbsp;and then filter for those tags and enforcements in Network Analysis. This can open the door to a possible string of previously unseen connections and sellers to be targeted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is beneficial if&nbsp;a team needs to focus on multiple online issues&nbsp;at any one time. It is also useful where issues are more ‘trends’&nbsp;that spread across a number of sellers and are therefore not specific to a single bad actor.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;novel issues or&nbsp;issues&nbsp;where sellers are known to change their behavior quickly, the preferred workflow would be enforcing all infringing items in a network at once.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Intelligence and investigations enable your business to identify high-value targets and to build detailed profiles on network operators. Key to a successful approach, however, is how you organize data and your team’s ability to collaborate.</strong></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/why-intelligence-and-investigations-are-key-to-an-integrated-brand-protection-approach/">part one of our Intelligence and Investigations series</a>, we discussed the nuances between targeting individual bad actors versus wider networks and shared best practices on gathering online and offline intelligence.</p>



<p>In this piece, we explore how to organize the data that you collect and how to foster a collaborative approach to ensure your targeted action is effective. As with part one of this series, insights and quotes are from our <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/webinar-intelligence-and-investigations/">Investigations and Intelligence webinar</a> panel: Claire Hendey,&nbsp;<strong>Unilever</strong>; Joshua S. Hopping and Helen Saunders,&nbsp;<strong>Incopro</strong>; Michael Fuller<strong>,&nbsp;IP Services Inc.</strong></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-part-1-data-organization">PART 1:&nbsp;DATA ORGANIZATION&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once you’ve found valid data, the next step is to organize and make sense of it. There are four different dimensions that affect how you organize and store your&nbsp;information and intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<ul type="1"><li><strong>How you physically record it</strong></li></ul>



<p>Store data electronically to make it easier for you and your team to search, retrieve and share it.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Single data storage location</strong></li></ul>



<p>Keep all data in one place rather than siloed across multiple locations. Many businesses use case management systems to centralize storage of their information and intelligence.&nbsp;This is about making data easier to retrieve and share later.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Use of data warehouse </strong><strong></strong></li></ul>



<p>Big spreadsheets of thousands of line items won’t work well in case management systems. This type of data is better placed in a data warehouse&nbsp;&#8211; designed to take large data sets that need to be cross-referenced.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>How you work with and visualize data</strong></li></ul>



<p>Finally, you want to make sure that you can&nbsp;manipulate data efficiently and create different views of the data.&nbsp;This helps you to think laterally about what you’re seeing and form connections.&nbsp;An example of this is <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/network-analysis/">Network Analysis</a> technology &#8211; it’s far easier to see a network of connected infringing entities a diagram than it is in rows of data.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-unilever-s-perspective-on-the-value-of-data-organization">Unilever’s perspective on the value of data organization</h3>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>“When we work with our providers, they become part of our ecosystem.&nbsp;This is a hub for&nbsp;our Brand Protection&nbsp;function and houses our case&nbsp;management,&nbsp;online&nbsp;data,&nbsp;global trademark portfolio&nbsp;coverage, customs&nbsp;recordal&nbsp;information and&nbsp;more.”</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; Claire Hendey, Global Brand Protection and IP Operations and Systems Manager, Unilever</p>



<p>An unstructured list of infringers with no context is not useful for Unilever. For Claire, it is therefore critical to enrich the data and extrapolate the issues into strategic impact areas (such as protecting consumer trust in Unilever brands, protecting consumers from harm etc.). It allows Unilever to make an informed decision on how to act and whether to investigate bigger networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unilever expect the matters to be worked on and communicated about within the system, utilizing Incopro’s Brand Protection platform <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Talisman</a> to build on what the business holds in its case management system. Claire’s team uses both environments to build a detailed case against high-value targets and bad actor network, with eyes on the whole data flow to utilize for high-impact action.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-private-investigator-perspective-on-the-value-of-data-organization">The private investigator perspective on the value of data organization&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Michael Fuller, Investigations Department Manager, &amp; licensed Private Investigator, IP Services Inc., states that data organization is key to success. His clients expect him to maintain accurate and accessible case files.&nbsp;Centralizing the data so it can be used and shared is Brand Protection investigations 101.</p>



<p>The value Michael brings to his clients by leveraging historical case work is paramount, keeping the client informed.&nbsp;Michael states that by making the connections to historical targets who disappeared 6 months ago only to resurface, investigators can add critical value to a target by demonstrating their commitment to continuing their&nbsp;nefarious business practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-part-2-collaboration">PART 2:&nbsp;COLLABORATION&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Brand owners have a number of issues to tackle and time is limited. As such, it is vital for brands owners to collaborate <strong>1) internally</strong> – between Brand Protection teams and other stakeholders across the business and <strong>2) externally</strong> – between other brand owners, relevant Brand Protection organizations, and authorities. This collaboration ensures consumers are protected and the business sees maximum return on investment from their Brand Protection strategy.</p>



<p>When targeting troublesome bad actor networks, collaboration between brand owners, law enforcement, investigators, and border authorities is crucial to take effective action.</p>



<h3 id="h-unilever-s-perspective-on-why-collaboration-is-essential">Unilever’s perspective on why collaboration is essential</h3>



<h4 id="h-internal-collaboration">Internal collaboration</h4>



<p>Traditionally, Unilever’s global&nbsp;teams were siloed. This limited the impact of Unilever’s Brand Protection activities, with Claire admitting that it made the business slow to act. Collaboration&nbsp;between teams and improved communication was therefore essential.</p>



<p>Claire states that Unilever’s Brand Protection teams, supply chain, marketing, and IP teams now all work together as task assignees in the business’ internal system to gain valuable input and clarification on actions and ongoing cases.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="h-external-collaboration">External collaboration</h4>



<p>Unilever’s wider external&nbsp;stakeholders and third-party&nbsp;providers &#8211;such as outside counsels and investigators &#8212; now work&nbsp;in their ecosystem&nbsp;to share and collaborate on the same data and intelligence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously there was little integration between online and offline. Unilever now uses the power of data to make larger, connected takedowns. External collaboration is important for the offline space. Claire states that Unilever harnesses its relationships with law enforcement agencies and Interpol/Europol and non-for-profit organizations such as REACT as they have a large combined global influence and can facilitate on the ground action against bad actor networks.</p>



<h4 id="h-collaboration-between-brand-owners">Collaboration between brand owners</h4>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>“Cross collaboration with other brand owners’ groups is key, such as </strong><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/insync-roundtable-how-to-deal-with-problematic-sellers-on-shopee-tokopedia/"><strong>INSYNC’s initiatives</strong></a><strong>.”</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; Claire Hendey, Unilever</p>



<p>Collaboration between brand owners represents an opportunity to share insights, best practices, intelligence and high-level data. Through this approach, businesses can target the largest bad actor networks operating online that are exploiting multiple brands and businesses. With combined resources and expertise, brands can take these networks down and protect consumers from harm.</p>



<p>Together, brand owners can also lobby for the changes needed from search engines, social media giants and e-commerce platforms to reduce the incidence of high-risk infringements and make it difficult for bad actors to hide.</p>

<h3 id="h-the-private-investigator-perspective-on-why-collaboration-is-essential">The private investigator perspective&nbsp;on why collaboration is essential</h3>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>“As&nbsp;an investigator, we are vested in our client’s successes and are committed to ensuring we protect their interest and support their brand protection initiatives. Communication between the brand and the investigators is very important.”</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; Michael Fuller, Investigations Department Manager, &amp; licensed Private Investigator, IP Services, Inc.</p>



<p>Often, investigators are brought into an investigation after other measures such as warning letters,&nbsp;cease &amp; desist letters, and phone calls have been exhausted by the brand.&nbsp;Knowing if the target has previously been contacted or approached, investigators can often leverage the information to better position the investigation for success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally,&nbsp;if investigators know what the deliverables looks like for the brand and how the brand measures their success, they can strategize&nbsp;and plan accordingly.&nbsp; It is very common for a brand to need multiple test purchases from the same seller – Michael states that by knowing this information ahead of time allows, he can better position subsequent purchases for success and gather the necessary intelligence to begin online and offline action against bad actors<strong></strong></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h2>



<p><strong>An ‘Ecosystem&nbsp;Focus’</strong></p>



<ul><li>A lasting&nbsp;impact is only possible through a holistic approach that considers&nbsp;online and offline&nbsp;activities&nbsp;by IP infringers&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Research into bad actor networks and investigations are key to this approach&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>An ‘End Game Focus’</strong></p>



<ul><li>Knowing your end game (I.e. the primary motivation) helps direct what information you need to gather and how to organize the data&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Brand Protection: Better Together&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Collaboration is crucial</li><li>Internal, external, between vendors, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The more we work together, the better we can address this growing issue of online brand infringement</li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Online and offline intelligence is critical to Brand Protection success, enabling your business to root out high-value targets, to discover network operators, and to examine specialist focus areas outside the usual scope of your Brand Protection team.</strong></p>



<p>With expert insights and quotes from our investigations and intelligence webinar panel: Claire Hendey, <strong>Unilever</strong>; Joshua S. Hopping and Helen Saunders, <strong>Incopro</strong>; and Michael Fuller, <strong>IP Services Inc</strong>., we share the latest best practices and explore how these are key to producing actionable data in your pursuit of bad actors.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Part 1:&nbsp;Networks vs Individual Infringements&nbsp;</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Targeting&nbsp;bad actor&nbsp;networks&nbsp;is key to a lasting reduction in threats.</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>It’s no secret that there are multiple threats facing brand owners&nbsp;on a daily basis. With the meteoric rise of e-commerce, it has become even more important to think through&nbsp;the strategy deployed to protect your brand and consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When developing a&nbsp;strategy,&nbsp;a key question that must be answered is whether your business focuses on individual infringements or, instead, finding and targeting&nbsp;entire&nbsp;networks. There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.</p>



<h3>Tackling individual infringements</h3>



<p>Using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Brand Protection technology</a>, brand owners can bulk enforce on hundreds of infringements at a time. With this type of enforcement technology, brand owner may question why they should invest time and resources into locating and researching networks.</p>



<p>Targeting individual infringement can be effective at removing highly visible infringements quickly to ensure that non-legitimate products do not end up in the hands of the consumer. However, for some brand owners this will feel like playing a game of whack-a-mole and is unlikely to have the desired high impact.</p>



<h3><strong>Taking a network approach</strong></h3>



<p>Claire Hendey, Global Brand Protection and IP Operations and Systems Manager at Unilever, states that her business focuses on many Brand Protection areas&nbsp;and approaches regions individually.&nbsp;E-commerce penetration is as low as <strong>5%</strong> in some&nbsp;regions, with some countries not fully digitized.</p>



<p>Claire asserts that Unilever are still heavily invested in the offline investigation space as it is&nbsp;still essential&nbsp;for larger, more&nbsp;impactful&nbsp;takedowns.&nbsp;For Unilever, taking an investigative approach to Brand Protection increases the chances of whole supply chain impact.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“This is why&nbsp;we invest in locating and taking down networks.&nbsp;We can now look at the data and make informed decisions to ensure&nbsp;we&nbsp;maximize&nbsp;the&nbsp;return on investment.”&nbsp;</strong></p><cite>&#8211; Claire Hendey, Unilever</cite></blockquote>



<p>Michael Fuller, Investigations Department Manager, &amp; licensed Private Investigator at IP Services, Inc., notes that businesses are often aware there is a counterfeit or grey market problem with their products. However, determining the scope and size of the problem poses a challenge.&nbsp;The business may only be aware of a single bad actor or that a suspect product has been identified on a marketplace.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“As Brand Protection investigators, we tend to start our investigations using the details provided by the client and expand our focus as the investigation evolves.&nbsp;Uncovering a network often starts by focusing on an individual.”</strong></p><cite>&#8211; Michael Fuller, IP Services Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Part 2:&nbsp;Intelligence Gathering&nbsp;</h2>



<p><strong>Where and how to find actionable data that delivers impact.&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>There is a vast, almost unlimited volume of data online.&nbsp;Businesses must consider how to obtain this information at scale and ensure that they can prioritize based on what is relevant to their brands.</p>



<p>It is critical to think about&nbsp;what your&nbsp;purpose&nbsp;is as this will help with where to look.&nbsp;A couple of examples to illustrate this:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Is your team looking to gather data at scale to detect the largest bad actors?&nbsp; If so, you need to look broadly and deal with vast amounts of data.&nbsp;You’ll be gathering information such as usernames, item descriptions, social media posts etc.&nbsp; This helps you to gather a broad range of data points to delve into.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Your team might be focused on one bad actor, in which case you might want to delve deeper into information about a website, a company or an individual, so you’ll use more focused open source intelligence tools.&nbsp;You might also use closed/paid for services to gather this information.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>Structured vs unstructured&nbsp;data</h3>



<p>Structured data that you find on e-commerce sites such as Amazon or eBay is laid out in data fields where you get consistent and well-organized information.&nbsp;This is great for building data tables and visualizations later because you don’t have to do too much to clean up that data and start analyzing it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unstructured data, such as social media posts, is another matter.&nbsp;This is harder to deal with as you need to extract key information from it and impose some form of structure on it.&nbsp;This means you may need to invest more time and resource to evaluate the data and instigate intelligence-led action.</p>



<h3>Data reliability</h3>



<p>Finally, evaluating the data and determining its&nbsp;reliability&nbsp;is essential &#8211; your business needs to&nbsp;know what it can trust.</p>



<p>You need to be careful to make sure you know how much reliance you can place on data from different places.&nbsp; For example, a telephone number on a&nbsp;suspicious website might be there just to lend legitimacy to it &#8211; the telephone number on a company registration document is likely to be more reliable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your Brand Protection team must think about where your data is coming from before you decide how much weight to place on it.&nbsp;Infringers will leave footprints behind them &#8211; patterns in data can help make it more meaningful.&nbsp;There is also a need for corroboration &#8211; making sure multiple sources tell you the same thing is also key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need to let the intelligence you’ve created guide you to the most meaningful and impactful&nbsp;targets that will drive the reason you’re interested in networks of bad actors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bad actors who are knowingly engaging in brand infringements are unethical and they often hide their activities behind a scheme and bank of lies to hide their identity, the authenticity of the products and protect their illicit gains.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“Simply put: Bad actors don’t want you to know who they are and as little as possible about their ‘business’.”</strong></p><cite>&#8211; Michael Fuller, IP Services Inc.</cite></blockquote>



<p>As a private investigator, Michael is challenged with weeding through all the details of an investigation, vetting out the facts and presenting his clients with the highest level of confidence in their reports that in which bad actors, business details and locations are identified.</p>



<p>Investigators look for collaborating evidence from multiple search tools to match identifying information such as addresses, phone numbers and online profiles. They then make phone calls, send emails, and aggregate all the details to determine the confidence level that we have accurately identified the culprits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The difference between information and intelligence</h3>



<p><strong>Information</strong> or <strong>data</strong> is something that tells you facts, for example, the price of a product or the number of listings someone has on a platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Intelligence</strong> on the other hand has gone through a process of evaluation and analysis to produce something that you can make decisions upon and which drives action. When you investigate and analyze threats to your brand, you are turning information into intelligence, upon which to base your actions.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The connection between the online and offline space</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“The connections come in many forms and by enhancing the data held by Incopro, our online monitoring (OLM) provider, with a variety of other source information into our global case management system means we can take a holistic approach to solving the issues.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><cite>&#8211; Claire Hendey, Unilever</cite></blockquote>



<p>Claire utilizes a team of investigators who assist with activity on the ground, market sweeps, and visits off the back of online detections. They harness shipment info from Customs and port Seizures to further enhance the picture, as well as the digital voice of our consumers – this feeds Unilever’s AI and machine learning&nbsp;capabilities, and enabled the business to enhance and visualize global issues and perform connected global projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Online and offline intelligence critical to Brand Protection success</h2>



<p>Intelligence and investigations are core tools in your arsenal to root out high-value targets and take down network operators online and offline. We’ve discussed the nuances of targeting individual bad actors versus wider networks and shared best practices on intelligence gathering, providing insight into how your business can see greater Brand Protection ROI.</p>
