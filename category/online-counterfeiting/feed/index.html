<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>At the INSYNC Virtual Summit: November 2021 we asked brand protection leaders about what their main priority for 2022 would be. See the results below:</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="636" height="566" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll_BP-leaders-2022-priorities_social-thumb.svg" alt="Brand protection priorities 2022" class="wp-image-18127"/><figcaption> <em>Poll of attendees at the INSYNC Virtual Summit: November 2021</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Collaboration, both internally and externally, are key priorities. We saw increased collaboration throughout 2021, but there is a still much more progress to be made with platforms and other intermediaries. Gaining a greater of understanding of overall threats to brands also ranked highly – in line with a growing appetite for better-quality and more comprehensive data. Another key priority is reporting impact, with teams looking to calculate the ROI of their programs and whether they are reducing the volume of online infringement.</p>



<p>Read this blog to learn more about these key priority areas and why brand protection teams are focusing on them.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Increasing the volume of takedowns</h2>



<p>The top result is&nbsp;increasing the number of takedowns, with <strong>22%</strong> of participants&nbsp;claiming this is their key priority.</p>



<p>While it’s understandable, particularly during periods of instability and an increase in online abuse, that teams focus on core goals of removing threats, it does suggest there’s an opportunity for teams to progress to think about both delivering more long-term outcomes with enforcement (such as reducing infringement saturation on priority channels), and to work towards other strategic goals that deliver commercial value.</p>



<p>One of the ways to progress in this way is by enhancing&nbsp;how teams show the impact of the brand protection program, so it’s promising to see this rank joint-second as a top priority (<strong>18%</strong>), alongside&nbsp;gaining a greater understanding of threats.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/brand-protection-kpis-how-to-focus-on-outcomes-not-takedowns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn how shifting the focus to outcomes delivers greater long-term value to the business &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Enhancing how teams report the impact of their programs</h2>



<p><strong>18% </strong>of participants ranked enhancing how they report the impact of their programs as their top priority.</p>



<p>Businesses are recognizing that reporting should go beyond the number of takedown notices sent. This metric does little to show real impact, leaving two crucial questions unanswered: 1. Are the enforced listings or websites staying down? 2. Is there a reduction in infringement volume across the platform or channel?</p>



<p>Therefore teams should pivot to using KPIs that focus on reducing the volume of infringement and cleaning up priority platforms or channels help teams demonstrate impact. With this approach, teams can also free up resources for other value-adding activities. They can then deliver commercial value to the business and vastly increase return on investment.</p>



<p>There are several outcomes that you can monitor to gauge the effectiveness of your brand protection program. Examples include:</p>



<ul><li>Reducing the levels of infringement on a priority platform. I.e. versus the previous month or the last six months</li><li>Reducing the number of issues on each of your priority channels.</li><li>Reducing infringement saturation – I.e. for a given search term on marketplaces how many listings returned are illegitimate vs. legitimate?</li><li>The impact on online revenue</li></ul>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Gaining a greater understanding of threats</h2>



<p>Data is critical. This is increasingly the message coming from brand protection teams.</p>



<p><strong>18%</strong> of participants said gaining a greater understanding of overall threats to their brands is the top priority for their team.</p>



<p>To achieve this, datasets need to be comprehensive – covering all key platforms and channels – and of high-quality – so teams can prioritize the high-risk threats without having to wade through streams of irrelevant data.</p>



<p>One method for improving data relevancy is taking a network-based approach to brand protection: collecting data from multiple sources and connecting related entities.</p>



<p>Indeed,<strong> 74%</strong> of brands are attempting to take a network-based approach <em>(INSYNC webinar: “Intelligence &amp; Investigations Masterclass – The Key to an Integrated Approach”).</em></p>



<p>Network analysis technology enables this approach. Businesses use network analysis technology to automatically identify and prioritize the online networks that threaten their consumers and brand, by connecting the multiple datapoints across every part of an infringer’s online operation.</p>



<p>Understanding a network involves connecting an individual to their varying online identities, then connecting these identities to various websites, seller IDs and accounts across multiple marketplaces and other online channels. There are many different types of data that can be used to build up a profile.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="10048" height="5348" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Network-connections-example_RGB_2.svg" alt="Brand protection network analysis" class="wp-image-18122"/><figcaption><em>Examples of datapoints that can be leveraged to uncover networks</em><br></figcaption></figure>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Securing additional budget</h2>



<p><strong>4%</strong> of participants stated that securing additional budget is their top priority for 2022.</p>



<p>In order to secure budget, brand protection teams need to build awareness and recognition of the importance of what they do. Core considerations when attempting to&nbsp;engage with senior leadership include:</p>



<ul><li>Looking beyond takedown numbers and justify investment in commercial terms.&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;strategic goals will vary by company. You need to think about what matters to your business and&nbsp;make sure you focus on what is measurable.</li><li>Showing&nbsp;that the uplift in revenue, plus any cost efficiencies, are greater than the cost of the program.&nbsp;When&nbsp;calculating&nbsp;costs, you should factor in the resources that are freed up to focus on other&nbsp;tasks.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>There are multiple&nbsp;tools&nbsp;you can&nbsp;use to&nbsp;measure the&nbsp;performance&nbsp;of&nbsp;brand&nbsp;protection:&nbsp;</p>



<h3>RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI)&nbsp;CALCULATION</h3>



<p>Look at the correlation between&nbsp;enforcement&nbsp;and&nbsp;your e-commerce sales&nbsp;(measuring&nbsp;from&nbsp;the same region).</p>



<h3>MARKETPLACE TESTING&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Marketplace test on a platform-by-platform basis to monitor sales growth before and after enforcement. This can provide compelling evidence of the success of targeted enforcement.</p>



<h3>UNAUTHORIZED SELLERS’ SALES VOLUMES&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Find examples of unauthorized sellers and their actual sales volumes to demonstrate revenue leakage. Consider combining quantitative data with storytelling&nbsp;to really&nbsp;hit the message&nbsp;home&nbsp;with senior leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Halting enforcement as a test&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Finally –&nbsp;it’s extremely powerful&nbsp;to illustrate what happens if you&nbsp;suddenly&nbsp;stop&nbsp;enforcement.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Increasing internal collaboration</h2>



<p>Increasing internal collaboration is cited as a key priority by <strong>11% </strong>of participants.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;type of value&nbsp;that&nbsp;brand protection teams generate&nbsp;depends on the industry&nbsp;–&nbsp;the common denominator is that it will&nbsp;always extend beyond the brand protection function.&nbsp;Key functions that you may be able to engage&nbsp;include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Marketing&nbsp;</li><li>E-commerce&nbsp;</li><li>Security&nbsp;</li><li>Supply chain&nbsp;&amp; distribution&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In order to facilitate collaboration, you’ll need to demonstrate the value of brand protection activity to the respective function. You must also speak their language to build a shared understanding –&nbsp;for marketing it may be about trust, brand values or&nbsp;campaign efficiency, for e-commerce it is likely to be focused on sales, or for security it can be helpful to focus on threats like phishing.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Improving relationships with marketplace &amp; social media platforms</h2>



<p>In total, <strong>24%</strong> of participants said their key priority in 2022 is to improve relationships with marketplaces (<strong>14%</strong>) and social media platforms (<strong>10%</strong>).</p>



<p>Strong platform relationships are critical to protecting consumers and ensuring a long-term reduction in brand abuse. Where&nbsp;your consumers shop and&nbsp;who&nbsp;they purchase from are key considerations when choosing the platforms you prioritize and develop robust relationships with.</p>



<p>Once key platforms to monitor and enforce on are identified, brand protection teams should seek to engage with them directly:</p>



<ul><li>Establish key contacts and organizing regular meetings</li><li>Sign-up for the platform’s brand protection program and tools</li><li>Using brand protection technology, monitor infringement trends and changes in behavior</li><li>Engage the platform at events and webinars</li></ul>



<p>A combination of direct communication, understanding platforms’ processes &amp; policies, and intelligence sharing means your enforcement efforts are strategic and more likely to be successful. Compliance and platform response times both improve with a strong relationship.</p>



<p>In a separate INSYNC poll, participants indicated that they would be willing to share more data with platforms. As expected, product and brand knowledge received the highest share of the vote (<strong>73%</strong>), and indeed is often the first type of data to be shared.</p>



<p>Interestingly, many brands indicated that they are willing to share trends seen on other online marketplaces (<strong>64%</strong>) and seller information (<strong>46%</strong>) – this would help to create a more joined-up, multi-stakeholder approach to fighting online infringement.</p>

<p>In 2022, we expect that brand protection teams will continue to evolve their strategies and foster both internal and external collaboration, allowing them to better protect consumers and grow their e-commerce revenues. Perhaps most critically, with a sharper focus on reporting impact and building a narrative around outcomes, teams can build recognition of brand protection as an activity that has wide applications across the business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2021 posed unique challenges to brand protection teams, with online threats increasingly varied, supply chains disrupted, and department budgets tightening.</strong></p>



<p>Throughout this year however, members of the global brand protection community INSYNC remained resolute in their goal to protect consumers, with teams continually adapting to the fast-evolving online environment. Quotes and insights from the INSYNC community show teams responding to prolonged global uncertainty and shifts in online behavior by refocusing strategy, collaborating with internal teams, and building relationships with e-commerce platforms.</p>



<p>Read this blog to learn about the key developments within the industry in 2021, including emerging threats, new legislation, and innovative approaches to brand protection strategy.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Emerging threats in 2021</h2>



<p>The pandemic has continued to disrupt supply chains across the globe, meaning consumers have had difficulty in obtaining certain branded products. Counterfeiters and other bad actors have seized this opportunity to impersonate brands and defraud consumers.</p>



<h3 id="h-social-media-phishing-and-scams">Social media phishing and scams</h3>



<p>Brands in 2021 faced a growing tide of phishing scams and other types of fraud targeting their customers on social media.</p>



<p>Social media cybercrime generates a staggering&nbsp;<strong>$3.25</strong> billion&nbsp;for criminal networks annually[1]. <strong>61%</strong> of companies&nbsp;experience phishing attacks via their social media channels[2]. And as social media usage continues to increase, scammers have sought new methods to exploit brands and consumers.</p>



<p>Facebook and Instagram have emerged as popular platforms for fake ‘brand giveaways’, where scammers impersonate well-known brands advertising offering free product giveaways. Once consumers submit their personal information, the scammers use this to conduct identity and financial fraud.</p>



<p>In a sign of growing frustration from authorities, the&nbsp;head of enforcement at the FCA (UK) stated:</p>



<p><em>“Social media sites are effectively a gateway in which scammers are getting access to vast numbers of people in the population through online searches.”[3]</em></p>



<p>While platforms are taking steps to combat scammers, it is clear they can go further. Businesses too must adapt their brand protection strategies to safeguard consumers’ digital safety and trust on social media as threats continue to grow.</p>

<h3>COVID-related scams</h3>



<p>Brands and consumers contended with a barrage of COVID-related scams and fake products during 2021. These threats included:</p>



<h4>Listings for COVID vaccines on B2B &amp; B2C marketplaces</h4>



<p>Incopro’s experts have detected several unauthorized listings claiming to be ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Direct Suppliers’ on B2B platforms EC21, Ecplaza, and Tradekey. With the listings not directly referring to branded vaccines, identifying the key platforms sellers use to advertise these fake or unauthorized products plays a significant role in proactive enforcement.</p>



<p>COVID vaccine listings can often also be found on B2C platforms such as eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist. These usually involve sellers offering slots to get the vaccine. COVID vaccine manufacturers have confirmed to Incopro that the majority of these online offers are scams.</p>



<h4>Criminals selling COVID-related products</h4>



<p>Fake vaccine passports / certificates and even COVID test results are being sold on e-commerce websites and, increasingly, the dark web[4].</p>



<p>Law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) in the US are pursuing false COVID-related products and are notifying registrars when their services are used by bad actors. However, with over 1,000 COVID-related domains being registered per day, it’s clear that registrars and web hosts need to do more.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Legislation targeting platforms – EU</h2>



<p>On the legislative front 2021 heralded many promising changes, with increased pressure placed on e-commerce platforms and other online intermediaries.</p>



<p>In December 2020, The European Commission published its much-anticipated&nbsp;Digital Services Act package of measures<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;in what may amount potentially to the most sweeping reforms to tech regulation in Europe for more than two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two separate pieces of legislation (the&nbsp;Digital Services Act&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Digital Markets Act) appear to signify the arrival of root and branch reform to the Internet platform economy, assuming the draft texts are adopted by the European Parliament and are enacted into law.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The Digital Services Act (DSA)</h3>



<p>The DSA is designed to regulate the way in which platforms handle illegal or harmful content in their capacity as intermediaries which connect consumers with goods, services and content.</p>



<p>A central theme to the DSA is the notion that technology companies will need now to take much more responsibility for unlawful behavior on their platforms – and will face serious financial penalties if they do not.</p>



<p>While brand owners welcome the proposed legislation, there are several key improvements that are needed. Perhaps most critical of these are:</p>



<ul><li>Trusted Flaggers – ‘Trusted Flagger’ rules should apply to all hosting services and trusted flagger status should be available to all entities which demonstrate expertise and a high rate of accuracy when flagging content regardless of whether or not they are part of trade associations or collective bodies.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Repeat Infringers – The scope of this provision is too narrow; it needs to apply to all hosting services (e.g. cyberlockers). It should also permit the termination of the provision of services in egregious cases – for example in cases of repeated suspension.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/the-digital-services-act-what-do-brand-and-content-owners-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about DSA changes requested by brand owners &gt;</a></p>



<h3>The Digital Markets Act (DMA)</h3>



<p>In contrast to the DSA,&nbsp;the DMA&nbsp;applies to large online platforms which act as “Gatekeepers” in digital markets – acting as critical gateways for business users to reach end users (consumers). This includes search engines, intermediation services, social networking services, video-sharing platforms, operating systems, interpersonal communication services, cloud computing and advertising[6].</p>



<p>The DMA seeks to regulate these platforms to ensure that the markets in which they operate remain fair and competitive. The DMA imposes restrictions and obligations to ensure that Gatekeeper platforms behave in a fair way online.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Legislation targeting platforms – US</h2>



<p>Similar trends were observed in the US, with legislators increasing looking at the role of platforms and online intermediaries in facilitating the sale or access of infringing products and services.</p>



<h3>The Shop Safe Act</h3>



<p>The US Shop Safe Act Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 (The Lanham Act), with the addition of a section to make e-commerce platforms liable for trademark infringement and counterfeiting if they do not follow a number of best practices such as screening sellers and enforcing against repeat infringers.</p>



<h3>The INFORM Consumers Act</h3>



<p>The US INFORM Consumers Act (The Integrity, Notification, and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers), requires online marketplaces to collect, verify and disclose certain information from high-volume third-party sellers.</p>



<p>Following discussions in the senate, e-commerce platforms lobbied to define high-volume third-party sellers to include those that conduct 200 or more transactions resulting in total revenues of $7,000 or more during a continuous 12-month period.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/shop-safe-inform-consumers-act-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about US legislative developments &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Increased focus on repeat infringers</h2>



<p>In early 2021 Incopro released ‘Three Strikes and Out’, a white paper that explores how e-commerce platforms can tackle repeat infringers – an issue that brand owners are increasingly highlighting.</p>



<p>We found that <strong>23</strong> of the <strong>34</strong> e-commerce platforms considered have a policy directed at repeat infringers. The remaining <strong>11</strong> had no relevant policy evident. Out of the <strong>23</strong> e-commerce platforms that have a policy, only 3 had enacted a three-strikes rule.</p>



<p>We noted that platforms that do have a clear ‘three strikes’ rule and robust seller verification process – such as Aliexpress – see fewer repeat infringements than other platforms.</p>



<p>The white paper analyzed over 1.5m enforcements to help understand the scale of the issue, before setting out how brands, platforms and legislators can address the challenge to protect consumers, reduce losses suffered to counterfeiting and support rights holders.</p>



<p>Incopro’s analysis shows that:</p>



<ul><li>Only&nbsp;<strong>6%</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;sellers&nbsp;are&nbsp;repeatedly enforced on <strong>3 days</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>more</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>However, these sellers are responsible for over&nbsp;<strong>24%</strong>&nbsp;of the listings Incopro has enforced against&nbsp;</li><li>The models show that&nbsp;a seller verification and repeat infringer policy would significantly benefit consumers, brands, legislators, and the platforms themselves</li></ul>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Recognition of outcomes, not takedowns</h2>



<p><strong>“It’s important we’re not seen as ‘whack-a-mole’. It’s only whack-a-mole if you don’t apply data.”</strong></p>



<p><em>Gary Wengrofsky, Senior Director, Intellectual Property, Charter Communications speaking at the INSYNC Virtual Summit: November 2021</em></p>



<p>In 2021, the shift towards outcomes picked up pace. Many brand protection teams now set KPIs that focus on reducing the volume of infringement and cleaning up priority platforms, rather than the number of takedown notices sent.</p>



<p>With this approach, teams can free up resources for both targeted enforcement against high-risk infringements and to conduct in-depth data analysis and other value-adding activities. They can then deliver commercial value to the business and vastly increase return on investment.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">A new brand protection maturity model</h2>



<p>With threats growing in both scale and variety, brand protection teams had a huge amount of ground to cover in 2021. From counterfeit goods and copycats, to fake NFTs and social media phishing scams, there are countless ways a company&#8217;s identity can be infringed and damaged online. The threats each business and industry faces vary, but there are general steps all organizations can take to evolve their approach.</p>



<p>As they mature, teams become an increasingly strategic asset — able not only to counter threats, but to identify new growth opportunities for the business.</p>



<p>In 2021, Incopro released an Online Brand Protection Maturity Report that outlines the four stages of this journey. From reactive teams that find themselves firefighting infringements, to effective teams that make use of advanced technology to tackle issues at scale, to progressive teams that champion wider applications of brand protection within their organizations.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>With e-commerce spending during Black Friday and Singles’ Day growing each year, brand protection teams need to be aware of the latest emerging threats and infringement trends. Read this blog to learn how you can protect your brand and consumers online during the holiday season.</strong></p>



<p>Counterfeiting, phishing, impersonation, and hashtag hijacking are just a handful of the online threats that brands face during the holiday season. And with an environment of fast-moving flash sales and large-scale discounting, it can be difficult to keep up with infringers.</p>



<p><strong>Read this blog to learn</strong>:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#consumer-behavior">The shifts in online consumer behavior</a></li><li><a href="#trends">The holiday infringement trends, including counterfeiting, phishing, and review fraud</a></li><li><a href="#solutions">How brands can protect consumers and key revenue streams</a></li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="consumer-behavior">The shifts in online consumer behavior</h2>



<p>In 2020, the US e-commerce market grew by over 30%, shooting past previous projections[1]. In the same year, US holiday spending reached $100 billion by December[2].&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2021 e-commerce growth has continued at lightning pace. In the US, e-commerce grew by 39.1% in Q1 2021. Comparatively, e-commerce grew by 13.8% in Q1 2020[3]. In Q2 2021, nearly $1 of every $5 spent on retail purchases in the US was online[4].</p>



<p>In the EU, total e-commerce revenues hit US$425.2bn in 2020, an increase of US$71bn from 2019[5]. And in 2021, the market is forecasted to grow by another 9.5%[6]. Brick-and-mortar footfall has shown signs of strong recovery from the pandemic, but its growth rate still lags behind e-commerce at 4.8%[7].</p>



<p>Online buying behavior often differs during the holiday season with consumers snapping up time-limited deals on third party e-commerce sites or marketplaces, instead of seeking out specific brands’ websites.</p>



<p>In China, the annual Singles’ Day e-commerce shopping festival has fueled an explosion in livestream sales. On just the first day of the Alibaba Singles’ Day pre-sales event, Li Jiaqi, a top livestream salesman sold a staggering US$1.9 billion in products and attained nearly 250 million video views[8]. </p>



<p>Deal aggregate websites often see a spike in traffic during the holiday season. These websites redirect to countless external sites, some of which are unfamiliar to the consumer and likely to have been set up only a few days prior. It is difficult for consumers to ascertain the legitimacy of these external sites, and they are at risk of inadvertently visiting scam sites</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="trends">Holiday season infringement trends</h2>



<p>COVID-19 caused widespread disruption to supply chains across the globe, impacting businesses’ ability to fulfill consumer demand. Infringers capitalized on this throughout the pandemic, with cases of falsified and substandard medical products were sold to consumers and, in some cases, even hospitals[9].</p>



<p>In 2021, similar activity has been observed in the run up to the holiday season, where supply from legitimate businesses is unable to meet demand and bad actors are seizing the opportunity to infiltrate marketplaces.</p>



<p>Delays at UK ports will result in toy shortages this Christmas, according to Gary Grant, CEO at UK toy retailer The Entertainer[10]. Infringers are likely to jump at this opportunity to plug the supply gap with fake goods.</p>



<h3>Counterfeits and other infringing listings</h3>



<p>The holiday season is a hotbed for brand infringement. And with the pandemic fueling record e-commerce demand in 2020, infringers were keen to promote their counterfeits and other infringing products to as many consumers as possible.</p>



<p>For example, in the week of Thanksgiving (the run up to Black Friday), compared to a week 3 months back, Incopro’s technology detected the following increases in counterfeit and other infringing listings on popular marketplaces:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="535" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-1024x535.png" alt="Holiday Season Brand Protection Counterfeit Listings" class="wp-image-17767" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-1024x535.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-300x157.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-768x401.png 768w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Percentage growth of infringement on Amazon &amp; eBay in the run up to the 2020 holiday season (Incopro data from 2020)</em> [11]</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Phishing scams and impersonation</h3>



<p>During the holiday season, social media platforms are inundated with both legitimate and illegitimate accounts promoting time-limited deals. Consumers may find it difficult to distinguish between the real and the fake, falling prey to impersonation accounts that redirect them to websites operating phishing schemes.</p>



<p>‘Thematic’ phishing scams pose a significant threat to brands and consumers during e-commerce festivals periods such as Black Friday and Singles’ Day. In one case, Facebook accounts masquerading as&nbsp;an FMCG brand&#8217;s official Facebook account were promoting fake giveaways and competitions in order to&nbsp;obtain consumers’ personal data.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="535" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-1024x535.png" alt="Holiday Season Brand Protection Phishing Scams" class="wp-image-17776" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-1024x535.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-300x157.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-768x401.png 768w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Between October and December 2020, one FMCG brand saw &#8216;competition&#8217; phishing scams&nbsp;grow by 14.5x (1350%) on Facebook (Incopro data from 2020)</em> [12]</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>After the holiday season, the number of anonymized consumer complaints&nbsp;for phishing scams&nbsp;received by the brand reduced swiftly – in January 2021 consumer complaints had dropped by almost 50%&nbsp;compared to December 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Incopro’s analysts detected a large increase in phishing scams targeting a household appliances brand in the run up to Black Friday 2020, compared to 2019. After Black Friday, these websites quickly switched their focus to Christmas themed scams. New Year’s themed websites emerged then soon after.</p>

<h3>Digital ads and hashtag hijacking</h3>



<p>Infringers effectively operate as a primary competitor, undercutting price and hijacking hard-earned brand equity. Without a dedicated strategy to tackle infringers during the holiday season, brands often find themselves with inflated digital spend as they vie for the same advertising space.</p>



<p>Social media advertising and hashtag hijacking are tactics used by bad actors to promote counterfeit and other infringing products during the holiday season. Incopro’s brand protection experts note the increasing use of ‘#blackfriday’ and ‘#promoblackfriday’ in Instagram posts to promote counterfeit products such as watches during the four-week run-up to Black Friday[13].</p>



<p>Bad actors also commonly use holiday-themed hashtags to promote phishing scams to unsuspecting consumers. These scam posts sit alongside posts from genuine accounts within ‘trending categories’ on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, making it difficult for consumers to spot the danger.</p>



<h3>Fake reviews</h3>



<p>97% of shoppers rely on online customer reviews to help make a purchase[14]. In the UK, online reviews influence up to £23 billion of annual consumer spending[15].</p>



<p>Bad actors use fake reviews as a tactic to lend an air of legitimacy to infringing products. Fake reviews pose an issue on global e-commerce and social media platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and Facebook – and even on dedicated review websites such as TripAdvisor.</p>



<p>Sellers manipulate star-rating systems and post positive reviews to push consumers towards purchases. Other popular practices include promising free gifts, vouchers or discounts to customers that leave positive or five-star reviews – this is often against of platforms’ seller policies.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded" id="solutions">Adapt your brand protection strategy for the holiday season</h2>



<h3>Build strong platform relationships</h3>



<p>Platform collaboration should sit as a core tenet of your brand protection strategy. Consider which marketplace or social media platform your customers visit most often and the sellers they purchase your products from. With this data, you can begin to prioritize and develop robust relationships with the platforms that hold the greatest commercial significance.</p>



<p>You should then seek to engage with them directly or through a trusted partner to educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform’s own reputation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/why-platform-relationships-are-critical-to-brand-protection-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about building platform relationships &gt;</a></p>



<h3>Collaborate with marketing and e-commerce functions</h3>



<p>Businesses that are unable to spot trends and threats in advance of the holiday season are unlikely to be able to tackle bad actors at scale; they will be reactive, rather than proactive in their enforcement efforts. They may quickly find themselves racing to the bottom in an attempt to keep up with infringers’ discounting and internal sales targets. Collaboration with your marketing and e-commerce teams is therefore essential to protecting price, profit margins, and brand equity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Through collaboration, you can build an understanding of the platforms that will receive the highest volume of traffic through the holiday season. You can also build a plan of action to protect popular product lines, any new product launches, and promotions during the period.</p>



<p>Additionally, you may be able to identify potential online opportunities for your business such as gaps in your product portfolio, untapped demand in new markets, and emerging e-commerce platforms.</p>

<h3>Harness advanced brand protection technology</h3>



<p>Technology plays a critical role in supporting an effective, year-round online brand protection program. Your team will need to be able to operate at scale, with greater visibility of risks and the ability to automatically detect threats across all channels, extract key data, prioritize targets, and enforce – all at scale.</p>



<p>Incopro Brand Protection Consultant <strong>Tosshan Ramgolam</strong> states: <em>“Listings taking part in e-commerce festivals such as Singles’ Day often feature banner images next to the price. </em>You’ll need brand protection technology that can<strong>&nbsp;</strong>either collect this information from the page source or<strong>&nbsp;</strong>deploys optical character recognition in order to extract the text embedded in these banners.<em> You can then use this data as an indicator for risk to monitor counterfeiting activity for brands.”</em></p>

<h4>Advanced brand protection technology: network analysis</h4>



<p>Your team will also need a solution to find, prioritize, and act against infringer networks that operate across multiple channels. With real time data, you can take down entire networks instead of individual accounts and can significantly impact infringers’ abilities to scale-up promotion in advance of the holiday season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Marketplaces, e-commerce websites and social media platforms are flooded by both fake versions of licensed goods and counterfeit cosmetics in the run up to seasonal events such as Halloween, at the expense of consumer safety and brand reputation.</strong></p>



<p>This Halloween, with festivities predicted to return with a bang and e-commerce spending projected to reach $2.94 billion[1] in the US, businesses are preparing to tackle a record volume of infringement.</p>



<p>It is critical brand protection teams work with platforms and utilize technology to take the fight to infringers and protect both consumers and licensees from ghastly threats.</p>



<p><strong>Read this piece to learn:</strong></p>



<ul><li>How infringers promote products during seasonal events</li><li>Fake costumes trends during Halloween</li><li>Fake cosmetics trends during Halloween</li><li>The brand protection solutions to tackle threats all year round</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-counterfeiters-prey-on-seasonal-sales-and-holidays">COUNTERFEITERS PREY ON SEASONAL SALES AND HOLIDAYS</h2>



<p>In 2020, 52% of US parents sourced Halloween costumes in physical stores[2]. However, this year 55% of parents plan to find costumes online[3], suggesting a continued shift in shopping habits – and a greater risk that consumers end up with fake products.</p>



<p>Bad actors use targeted advertising on social media and promoted listings on marketplaces to offer counterfeit and unlicensed goods to unsuspecting consumers. Adverts offer infringing products a level of credibility, fooling many consumers into thinking they are purchasing goods from official channels.</p>



<p>Infringing listings and scam websites often disappear without a trace after the seasonal demand drops-off, leaving consumers out of pocket and unable to replace their low-quality product in time for the festivities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left has-small-font-size"><em>Spikes in infringing listings for costumes based on characters from popular children’s brands (Incopro, 2021)</em></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-fake-licensed-goods-haunting-marketplaces">FAKE LICENSED GOODS HAUNTING MARKETPLACES</h2>



<p>Each year, online marketplaces are inundated with listings for costumes and props in the run up to Halloween. Some of these are genuine – unfortunately many are not. Often these costumes are based on popular films, TV shows, video games, and comics. Licensees are left helpless as their listings are pushed further and further down marketplace search rankings, with unlicensed merchandise and counterfeits taking their place.</p>



<p>Counterfeit or otherwise unlicensed costumes also put consumers at risk. They are often made with low-quality materials and may easily tear. In October 2021, an online store ‘Mr Gadget Solutions’ based in the UK was recently fined for selling counterfeit children’s costumes that could have posed a fire risk[4]. The costumes – for popular superheroes such as Batman – were sold on eBay for less than £5.</p>



<p>Brands must act. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incopro research</a> finds that consumers who end up with counterfeits will direct the majority of their criticism at the brand rather than the platform – <strong>52%</strong> of consumers who unintentionally purchase fakes will lose trust in a brand[5].</p>

<p>Our brand protection analysts have identified a number of counterfeit and unlicensed costumes heading into Halloween 2021. Popular South-Korean drama Squid Game recently took the streaming world by storm, and a quick scan of eBay and Amazon reveals dozens of high-risk listings.</p>



<p>With Netflix seemingly caught by surprise at the popularity of the show, there is little official merchandise available. Opportunistic infringers have instead filled the gap with unlicensed merchandise, using lifted still images from the hit series and trademarks in their listings.</p>

<p>Superheroes and villains are prized targets at Halloween. With the recent release of The Suicide Squad in cinemas, infringers have listed costumes and temporary tattoos designed to emulate the look of fan-favorite Harley Quinn. Again, this listing uses lifts imagery from the film’s marketing materials such as posters and promotional stills.</p>

<p>Cosmetics are also a popular target for bad actors. $69 million worth of fake cosmetic and pharmaceutical products were seized in the US in 2017, making up 6.5% of all counterfeit seizures.</p>



<p>Multi-colored lenses are often used as a finishing touch to Halloween costumes. Fake contact lenses are widely available, with PIPCU and the US government warning against their purchase.</p>



<p>Counterfeit contact lenses can be particularly dangerous, either through incorrect usage (contact lenses are usually prescribed) or due to the materials used. Opticians warn that their use can lead to infections, conjunctivitis, and impaired vision[6]. Seized counterfeit contact lenses have even been found to contain toxic materials such as lead[7].</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-brand-protection-solutions-to-tackle-threats-all-year-round">Brand protection solutions to tackle threats all year round</h2>



<p>Platform collaboration should sit as a core tenet of your brand protection strategy. Consider which marketplace or social media platform your customers visit most often and the sellers they purchase your products from. You&#8217;ll also need to be cognisant of the platforms used by your licensees to sell their goods. With this data, you can begin to prioritize and develop robust relationships with the platforms that hold the greatest commercial significance.</p>



<p>You should then seek to engage with them directly or through a trusted partner. The following checklist is useful to kick off your relationship building exercise:</p>



<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts within the platforms’ support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;</li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;</li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;and interact with the relevant representatives where the platform has local websites</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-advanced-online-brand-protection-technology-critical-to-success">Advanced online brand protection technology critical to success</h3>



<p>It is critical to deploy <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/online-brand-protection/talisman-brand-protection-software/">online brand protection technology</a> that works in tandem with platform tools to tackle infringements such as counterfeit or unlicensed costumers at scale, but also:</p>



<ul><li>Collects more data on the individuals exploiting your brand</li><li>Prioritizes high-risk listings that your consumers are most likely to find</li><li>Makes the connection between brand exploiters operating across multiple channels and regions</li></ul>



<p>The following are some of the key indicators used to identify and prioritize infringements:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Price</strong>&nbsp;– fake costumes are listed for prices as low as £3.99 to undercut genuine listings</li><li><strong>Typos or grammatical mistakes within the listing</strong> –&nbsp;spelling mistakes of the product or brand name are intentional to deceive consumers</li><li><strong>Seller address and item location</strong> –&nbsp;the listing may claim to be domestic stock but is actually shipped from overseas (or if the seller’s business address is registered overseas)</li><li><strong>Text embedded within listing images</strong> – infringers may embed information such as price, contact details, and product description to avoid keyword detection. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/online-brand-protection/automation-image-technology/">Optical character recognition technology</a> will extract this information.</li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The NFT market poses an opportunity for brands, but also hidden risks, with counterfeiters and scammers targeting platforms and rights owners. Find out the key threats and how brand protection teams can mitigate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The market for NFTs&nbsp;has&nbsp;exploded recently, with more than $2bn spent in the first quarter of 2021.&nbsp;Global brands are&nbsp;capitalizing&nbsp;on this&nbsp;fertile new ground&nbsp;—&nbsp;the&nbsp;NBA&nbsp;is one organization&nbsp;to have taken advantage of the market so far, creating video clips for fans to collect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As with&nbsp;most&nbsp;emerging&nbsp;opportunities,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;associated threats&nbsp;that brand protection teams&nbsp;should be aware of. The NFT market is no different,&nbsp;as&nbsp;counterfeiters and scammers&nbsp;target&nbsp;nascent&nbsp;platforms and regulations&nbsp;that are some way off&nbsp;being able to fully protect&nbsp;brands and rights owners.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Read this blog to learn:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>What exactly are NFTs&nbsp;and&nbsp;how are they created, stored, and&nbsp;traded?&nbsp;</li><li>How&nbsp;copyright and ownership&nbsp;laws&nbsp;work&nbsp;with NFTs&nbsp;</li><li>How&nbsp;infringers are targeting consumers with fakes, scams,&nbsp;and&nbsp;other&nbsp;tactics&nbsp;</li><li>How&nbsp;brand protection teams can mitigate threats&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-what-is-an-nft">What is an NFT?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>An NFT (non-fungible token) is a unique token created in relation to a specific digital asset, like an image, music track or video clip. People commonly, and mistakenly, think of the asset as the NFT. However,&nbsp;it is the token that is the NFT.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-what-are-nfts-used-for">What are NFTs used for?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>NFTs are well suited to digital collectibles, such as video clips, music tracks,&nbsp;or&nbsp;in-game items. The accuracy and traceability of ownership is the key attraction&nbsp;here.&nbsp;They&nbsp;are also being tried out for unique physical items, but&nbsp;how&nbsp;applicable they are to real world items&nbsp;remains&nbsp;to be seen.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-are-nfts-linked-to-blockchain">How are NFTs linked to blockchain?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The NFT is stored on a blockchain. There are different blockchains, but the most popular for NFTs is&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>. Once on the blockchain, the NFT can be validated, and changes of ownership updated and tracked. This is how the value is passed from owner to owner and anyone can trace the provenance of an asset with certainty.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-do-you-create-an-nft">How do you create an NFT?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>To create an NFT, the creator goes through a process called minting. This process requires the creator to have a wallet with crypto currency in it (e.g.&nbsp;Ethereum), so that the newly created NFT can be linked to the wallet. This establishes the wallet owner as both the original creator and the first owner of the NFT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crypto currency is used to pay the gas fee necessary for minting. This fee is required to successfully complete the transaction on the blockchain and goes to the miners who provide the computing power (gas)&nbsp;behind the network.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-are-nft-s-stored">How are NFT’s stored?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The digital asset is stored either on-chain or off-chain. Some NFTs encode the content in the blockchain data (on-chain) or describe an algorithm for generating an image from the transaction hash. However, the most common storage is off-chain. This means that the NFT resides on the blockchain but the asset itself must be hosted on a server elsewhere with a link to it in the NFT.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-are-nfts-purchased">How are NFTs purchased?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The creation, sale, and trade of NFTs take place on platforms like&nbsp;<a href="https://rarible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rarible</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://opensea.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSea</a>. Users of those platforms can mint their own NFTs, buy, sell and trade them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-brand-protection-considerations-for-nfts">Brand Protection Considerations for NFTs&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-nft-copyright-ownership">NFT copyright&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;ownership&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Upon creation, copyright will subsist as it does ordinarily, dependent on jurisdiction. When the NFT is minted, the copyright owner does not necessarily give away the copyright with the NFT. The two exist separately unless they include assignment of copyright with the NFT. This means that the owner of the copyright can be recognised from the blockchain record and credited with any royalties that may come from exploitation of the work later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NFT and the asset are often separate things, as off-chain storage is the most common method for storing NFTs. This means that the copyright work may still be accessible to the public and able to be copied easily, infringing copyright when the copy is made. This is an important consideration for NFT creators as the creation does not automatically protect the work in any way.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-what-are-counterfeit-nfts">What are counterfeit NFTs?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If a brand mints its own NFTs then it is likely that others will look to issue further identical NFTs in order to confuse consumers. Given that this is likely to happen most in the collectibles space, it will be important to consider how consumers can gain confidence that they are buying the real thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider&nbsp;including an embedded watermark/fingerprint and a verification technology for consumers to check. This is a typical consideration for any content creator. Alternatively, issuing information about the number of NFTs that have been officially minted and sold could give consumers information to recognise flooding of the market for limited edition NFTs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-infringing-nfts-which-include-copyright-work">Infringing&nbsp;NFTs&nbsp;which include copyright work&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A brand may not&nbsp;produce&nbsp;its own NFTs, in which case an infringer could create a work that infringes copyright and then mint an NFT, offering it for sale. In this case, the rights owner may wish to ask the trading platform to remove the NFT from sale, as an infringement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Platforms like&nbsp;Rarible&nbsp;do state that they do abide by laws such as copyright, money laundering and fraud. In this instance, they will remove the NFT from their platform but the NFT will still exist on the blockchain and could be traded elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The additional question in this scenario is whether platforms&nbsp;like&nbsp;Rarible, could be encouraged to employ proper due diligence methods before allowing the creator to mint the NFT. For example,&nbsp;using&nbsp;image matching technology&nbsp;to determine if known works were copied.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-impersonation">Impersonation&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In early 2021, Banksy-style NFTs sold for $900,000. Given Banksy’s anonymity, buyers were not sure if this was the real Banksy or someone impersonating him. It turned out of be the latter.&nbsp;Domain names were registered such as banksynft.com and banksynfts.com, creating the possibility for further scams in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-copying-of-popular-nft-content">Copying of popular NFT content&nbsp;</h3>



<p>As mentioned, the content and NFT are held separately and access to the content is not necessarily limited to the owner of the NFT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should be a consideration when thinking about the long-term value of the NFT. If it is very easy to copy the content and anyone can obtain it then it may not be as valuable on resale. Retaining value really relies on creating a strong collectibles market, with value lying in scarcity.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-fake-nft-stores">Fake NFT stores&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Copying legitimate NFT trading platforms like&nbsp;Rarible, buyers may be tricked into giving their personal information and potentially funds to a platform that looks exactly like a well-known and legitimate platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-replica-nft-stores">Replica NFT stores&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Similar to the fake NFT stores, new stores could be created which are pure scams. They will have been set up to look like the next trading platform, but provide no functionality and harvest personal information and perhaps funds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-how-can-brand-protection-technology-support-nfts">How can brand protection&nbsp;technology&nbsp;support NFTs?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The emerging world of NFTs is an important aspect to be considered&nbsp;for many&nbsp;brand protection strategies. Whether minting and selling official NFTs or continuing to protect copyright assets, it is important that technology helps to combat new threats&nbsp;by:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Monitoring&nbsp;for domains that appear to be NFT trading/minting platforms which&nbsp;may be used to scam users and ensure&nbsp;discovery of URLs within that domain&nbsp;which may be offering NFTs infringing on&nbsp;the brand&nbsp;</li><li>Monitoring&nbsp;for domains that are purporting&nbsp;to be official NFT stores for the brand&nbsp;</li><li>Scraping&nbsp;legitimate platforms to find fake&nbsp;NFTs or otherwise infringing works that&nbsp;have been minted and make use of our&nbsp;imaging technology to detect any&nbsp;substantial copying of protected works&nbsp;</li><li>Tracking&nbsp;legitimate NFT content to&nbsp;determine if there is widescale&nbsp;distribution that would erode value&nbsp;</li><li>It’s also important&nbsp;for brand protection teams&nbsp;to build&nbsp;relationships with platforms to ensure they have&nbsp;effective takedown&nbsp;procedures in place, and are&nbsp;considering proactive measures to&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;the&nbsp;minting and sale of infringing&nbsp;NFTs.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>New Incopro research reveals that 1 in 5 fake listings come from only 3% of illicit sellers.</strong> <strong>Up&nbsp;to $78bn in annual losses could be prevented if platforms proactively removed these repeat breachers.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/three-strikes-and-out-how-e-commerce-platforms-can-protect-consumers-from-repeat-offenders/#download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incopro’s recent white paper</a> provides brands, e-commerce platforms and legislators with data on the proportion of repeat infringements undertaken by the same sellers, who use key global online marketplaces and social media platforms to infringe intellectual property.</p>



<p>The white paper also reports on the policies and procedures for repeat infringements currently employed by major online e-commerce platforms. </p>



<p>Finally, it presents detailed findings on the reduction in online counterfeiting and the commercial savings that could be secured if key e-commerce platforms combined:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>1. robust seller verification; and</strong></li><li><strong>2. a “three strikes and out” rule.</strong></li></ul>



<h3 id="h-what-is-a-repeat-breacher">What is a repeat breacher?</h3>



<p><strong>For the purpose of our study, we define repeat breachers as sellers that host multiple listings which infringe brand owners’ intellectual property (and/or repeatedly infringe platform policies).</strong></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-e-commerce-platforms-and-repeat-breachers">E-commerce platforms and repeat breachers</h2>



<p>Forrester&nbsp;estimates that 82% of global B2C e-commerce growth over the past few years came from marketplaces [1]. Bad actors have been swift to exploit this growth, with the global economic value of counterfeiting and piracy potentially reaching $4.2 trillion USD by 2022 placing 5.4 million legitimate jobs at risk [2].</p>



<p>Incopro’s data shows that the&nbsp;proportion of&nbsp;sellers who&nbsp;repeatedly infringe rights and harm consumers&nbsp;typically&nbsp;comprises&nbsp;under <strong>3%</strong> of&nbsp;the total sellers enforced,&nbsp;but&nbsp;these&nbsp;sellers are responsible, on average, for over <strong>20%</strong> of the illicit issues detected and notified on the e-commerce operations considered in the study.</p>



<p>Draft legislation in both the US (such as the SHOP SAFE and SANTA Acts) and Europe (such as the Digital Services Act) contemplates requiring online e-commerce platforms to take steps to verify and authenticate sellers and promoters before they can use the platform. The legislation also considers requiring these platforms to implement policies to stop sellers who repeatedly infringe intellectual property. You can read a summary of the draft legislation <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/can-the-current-regulatory-landscape-tackle-growing-brand-misuse-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Our white paper focuses on providing evidence to inform the discussion on proposed legislative changes. The following is an example of what can occur in the absence of a seller verification and a three-strikes rule:</p>



<p><strong>In the course of 2020, a seller used the same e-commerce operation in Latin America to offer consumer goods for sale. In total, Breaches in respect of 9 different consumer brands were found by Incopro’s technology. On each occasion, Incopro’s technology notified the e-commerce operation of the Breach and the seller’s online identification. The e-commerce operation was asked to remove the offer for sale. Over the course of a year, 107 different Breaches were identified. On one day, 27 separate Breaches that each offered a fake or inferior product for sale were reported to the e-commerce operation.</strong></p>



<p>This bar chart&nbsp;below&nbsp;identifies the time period for the Breaches and notifications to the e-commerce operation.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="689" height="505" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14324" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1.png 689w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /></figure>



<p>Although this e-commerce operation was notified about the same seller on 27 separate days &#8211; and with increasing frequency, this seller was not suspended. The seller was free to continue to use the platform to offer goods that might place consumers at risk.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-current-platform-policies">Current Platform Policies</h2>



<p>Platforms can protect both brands and consumers by effectively tackling repeat breachers. However, policies currently adopted by many platforms do not do enough to prevent repeat infringement.</p>



<p>Our findings indicate:</p>



<ul><li><strong>23</strong> <strong>out of the</strong> <strong>34</strong> platforms investigated have a policy against repeat breachers that is readily available to users &#8211; the remaining <strong>11</strong> have no relevant policy evident.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Out of the</strong> <strong>23</strong> platforms that have a policy directed at repeat breachers, only <strong>3</strong> have a policy which includes the 3-strike rule. These <strong>3</strong> platforms are based in the APAC region, and three serious offences on separate occasions result in account termination.</li></ul>



<p><strong>10 out of 23 </strong>platforms with a relevant policy have published definitions of the duration of account suspension. Again, amongst these <strong>10</strong> platforms only <strong>2</strong> have a policy that considers repeat offences sufficient ground for immediate termination.</p>



<p>It is noticeable that platforms like Aliexpress, which has a clear ‘three strikes’ rule and robust seller verification process, sees fewer repeat breaches than other platforms. Similarly, while Facebook and Instagram prefer not to disclose their policies publicly (to avoid gaming by bad actors), we are aware that they pay close attention to the issue of repeat breaches.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-new-methods-for-tackling-repeat-breachers">New methods for tackling repeat breachers</h2>



<h3 id="h-robust-seller-verification">Robust seller verification</h3>



<p>Platforms could require sellers to verify their identity before allowing them to advertise products for sale. This would serve to dissuade some bad actors from using these platforms, while also making enforcement and further action easier if they do go through the verification process. Seller verification is commonly achieved through credit card, bank statements or utility bills, or through government-issued identification cards.</p>



<p>Some platforms, such as Amazon and Alibaba, have already brought in forms of seller verification – although these policies could be strengthened. Others have yet to commit to seller verification, and consumers continue to be put at risk by anonymous seller accounts.</p>



<p><strong>Additional to robust seller verification, platforms should bring in a simple ‘three-strikes-and-out’ policy to tackle repeat infringement. Below, we have outlined two different thresholds that could be adopted.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-three-strikes-and-out-model-1-threshold-3-separate-days-of-enforcement">Three Strikes and Out Model 1: Threshold = 3 separate days of enforcement</h3>



<p>Platforms could adopt a policy where a seller is blocked from advertising further products for sale when a limit of 3 separate days of enforcement is reached.</p>



<h3 id="h-three-strikes-and-out-model-2-threshold-3-enforced-listings">Three Strikes and Out Model 2: Threshold = 3 enforced listings</h3>



<p>Alternatively, platforms could adopt a policy where a seller is blocked from advertising further listings when a limit of 3 enforced listings is reached. In the White Paper, this is modelled by grouping data based on the number of separate listings that have been enforced.</p>



<h3 id="h-three-strikes-in-action-japanese-marketplace">Three Strikes in action &#8211; Japanese marketplace</h3>



<p>A seller used an e-commerce platform in Japan and created <strong>2,063 </strong>separate listings under the same name for products copying the intellectual property of a fashion brand protected by Incopro. Incopro’s technology discovered these listings as they appeared over the course of the year. Each time listings were discovered, notices were sent to the e-commerce operation to remove the products. Notices were sent on <strong>42 </strong>separate days over the course of the year. Each time, the notified listings were removed by the platform, but the seller was able to continue listing offers on that platform.</p>



<p>If the seller had been stopped from using the marketplace after 3 listings were reported and removed, at least <strong>2,060 </strong>of the seller’s infringing listings would not have required enforcement (see figure 2 below).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top"><img width="751" height="551" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Figure-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14958" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Figure-2.png 751w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Figure-2-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /><figcaption><strong>Key</strong>:<br><strong>BLUE </strong>= listings enforced before the cut-off point had been reached.<br><strong>RED</strong> =&nbsp;listings enforced after the cut-off point had been reached.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="heading-branded">The impact of tackling repeat breachers</h2>



<p>Incopro’s analysis shows that:</p>



<ul><li>Only&nbsp;<strong>6%</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;sellers&nbsp;are&nbsp;repeatedly enforced on 3 days or more&nbsp;</li><li>However, these sellers are responsible for over <strong>24%</strong>&nbsp;of the listings Incopro has enforced against&nbsp;</li><li>The models show that&nbsp;a seller verification and repeat breacher policy would benefit consumers, brands, legislators, and the platforms themselves</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-1-commercial-savings">1. <strong>Commercial savings </strong></h3>



<p>Implementing either of these models could deliver reduce the availability of potentially harmful or low quality, non-genuine products to consumers by a minimum of <strong>11%</strong>&nbsp;(Model 1)&nbsp;or up to <strong>24%</strong>&nbsp;(Model 2). Given the losses suffered to online counterfeiting are estimated at over <strong>$320bn</strong> annually, this could equate to consumer savings of <strong>$35bn</strong> under Model 1 and up to <strong>$78bn</strong> under Model 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-protecting-consumers">2. Protecting consumers</h3>



<p>However, the benefit is not just financial. Non-genuine listings and counterfeits are often low-quality products, or those that may not meet regulatory standards, and are therefore highly likely to&nbsp;pose risks to consumer health and safety. </p>



<h3 id="h-3-platforms-benefit">3. Platforms benefit</h3>



<p>Additionally, given research suggests <strong>33%</strong> of consumers hold e-commerce operation responsible for addressing these issues, and <strong>64%</strong> of consumers have lost trust in a platform after unintentionally buying counterfeit products on that platform, addressing this issue effectively is also likely to drive the commercial success of e-commerce marketplaces [3].</p>

<p>Incopro&#8217;s analysis shows that a significant volume of counterfeiting and other brand misuse online could be stamped out if platforms implemented a strong verification process and one of the “three-strikes-and-out” policies put forward by Incopro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>More needs to be done to stop bad actors from misusing e-commerce platforms to infringe rights and harm consumers. With consumers increasingly using&nbsp;e-commerce platforms to buy products and secure services, it is critical for platforms and law makers to act.</strong></p>



<p>E-commerce platforms are essential to our everyday lives but are not properly regulated &#8211; in stark contrast to many other areas of the online ecosystem. In this blog, we explore the acceleration in e-commerce and look at the legislation that lawmakers are hoping will even the playing field against emboldened bad actors online.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">The Acceleration in E-Commerce and Risk of Consumer Harm</h2>



<p>Supercharged by the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce is the fastest growing retail segment in Europe and in North America[1]. According to Adobe’s Digital Economy Index (published February 2021), there was 42% year-over-year (YoY) e-commerce growth in 2020 [2]. In 2021, this acceleration in e-commerce is showing no little sign of slowing down, with 34% YoY growth between Jan and Feb 2021.</p>



<p>According to eMarketer, US based sales from ecommerce in 2020 were approximately $794.5 Bn USD, an increase of 32% year-on-year[3].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Significantly, this growth is being driven primarily by online marketplaces rather than e-commerce websites operated by traditional brick-and-mortar brands. Forrester&nbsp;estimates that 82% of global B2C e-commerce growth came from marketplaces – demonstrating the importance of effective consumer protection on these channels[4].</p>



<h3 id="h-brand-misuse-continues-to-grow-online">Brand Misuse Continues to Grow Online</h3>



<p>Bad actors have been swift to exploit e-commerce growth. It is estimated that the global economic value of counterfeiting and piracy could reach $4.2 trillion USD by 2022, placing 5.4 million legitimate jobs at risk[5].</p>



<p>Key figures:</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>The OECD estimates that trade in fake goods (as of March 2019) is <strong>3.3%</strong> of global trade and rising[6].&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>As of June 2020, EUIPO &amp; the OECD estimates that that the extent of counterfeit goods in global trade has reached as much as <strong>$509 billion</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>EUIPO &amp; the OECD the estimated direct and indirect sales losses attributable to counterfeiting in Europe amount to <strong>EUR 83</strong> billion each year.&nbsp;</li><li>The Global Brand Counterfeiting Report, 2018 estimates that the amount of counterfeiting globally had reached <strong>$1.2</strong> Trillion by 2019 and that the losses suffered from online counterfeiting amounted to <strong>$323</strong> Billion in 2017 [7].</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">A summary of the legislation under consideration in the US and EU</h2>



<p>Recognizing the growing risk of consumer harm and economic loss posed by brand misuse online, lawmakers in the US and EU have tabled potential legislation aimed at helping brand owners secure greater protection for their products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following legislation directly pertains to e-commerce platforms and enforcing greater seller transparency.</p>



<h3 id="h-us-legislation">US Legislation&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>SHOP SAFE&nbsp;Act&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Shop Safe Act was a bi-partisan Bill introduced on 2 March 2020 with the aim of “<em>creating accountability to prevent hazardous items from infiltrating the homes of millions of Americans</em>”[8].&nbsp;The Bill is not currently before Congress for consideration, but it is widely expected to be re-introduced in some form.&nbsp;Its key features included:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>a codified&nbsp;set of ‘best practices’&nbsp;on screening sellers&nbsp;and tackling&nbsp;repeat offenders in return for liability&nbsp;protection;&nbsp;</li><li>a focus on&nbsp;goods with a health and safety component (goods which may give rise to&nbsp;illness/disease/injury/serious adverse events/allergic reactions or death);&nbsp;</li><li>application to&nbsp;any&nbsp;E-commerce&nbsp;platform&nbsp;which&nbsp;sells&nbsp;to US consumers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Trademark Modernization Act (“the TMA”)</strong></p>



<p>The TMA was enacted into law on 27 December 2020 with the aim of strengthening and improving the accuracy and integrity of the federal trademark register. Its key features include:</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>improving US Trade Mark Office registry process and procedures including measures to improve consumer protection (including codification of a rebuttable presumption of irreparable harm in the event of a Court finding there has been an infringement given the consumer protection concerns which would arise otherwise).</li></ul>



<p><strong>INFORM Consumers Act&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The INFORM Consumer Act will require online marketplaces to collect and authenticate basic seller information which sellers must also provide to consumers. Its key features include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>requiring online retail marketplaces which include third-party sellers of consumer products to authenticate the identity of “high-volume third-party sellers” through disclosure of seller information, government IDs, tax registration details, business address,&nbsp;telephone&nbsp;and email, etc.</li></ul>



<p><strong>SANTA Act&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The SANTA Act is another consumer protection orientated, bipartisan initiative focussed on transparency.&nbsp;Its key features include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>requiring marketplaces to display a seller’s full name, business address, telephone number and working email&nbsp;address;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>a requirement to notify buyers if the product shipped is supplied by a seller other than the one detailed in the product listing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-eu-legislation"><strong>EU Legislation&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><strong>The Digital Services Act&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>The Digital Services Act (the “DSA”), published by the European Commission on 15 December 2020, represents potentially the most sweeping reform to regulation of the internet economy in Europe in close to two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the Act’s remit will be improving transparency rules first introduced within Article 5 of the EU E-Commerce Directive (“ECD”). Under current rules, bad actors can still mask their identity and keep key details of their illicit online operations hidden.</p>



<p>A “Know Your Business Customer” (“KYBC”) principle will therefore be introduced in the upcoming DSA package. Hosting providers will not be allowed to provide services to business users who provide identity information that is invalid or false.</p>



<p>If the legislation is enacted, platforms will find themselves having to do much more to protect brands and consumers – and may face financial penalties if they do not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DSA includes:</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>A requirement that larger E-commerce platforms verify seller information to establish the&nbsp;true identity&nbsp;of the seller.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>A requirement for platforms to suspend for “a reasonable period of time” (and after having issued&nbsp;a prior warning), the provision of their services to recipients that frequently (repeatedly) provide manifestly illegal content. No guidance is given on what amounts to a “reasonable period of time.”&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Platforms need to play their part</h2>



<p>While legislation has a critical role to play, it can be a blunt tool and may not immediately remedy the issue.</p>



<p>We are calling on e-commerce marketplaces to proactively work with brands, lawmakers, and companies such as Incopro to improve the policies and processes they employ to tackle bad actors exploiting their platforms.</p>



<p>Together, we can harness mechanisms such as intelligence sharing and working groups to provide better protections for brands and consumers online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>As we begin to slowly emerge from the shadow of COVID-19, consumers still need to be vigilant of scams and fake products offered by bad actors online. And pharmaceutical companies that are producing life-saving vaccines have now emerged as the next big target for criminal operations.</strong></p>



<p>Bad actors have once again shifted focus, moving on from COVID-19 testing kits to selling fake vaccines, hijacking pharmaceutical brand names, and spreading disinformation.</p>



<p>Incopro’s Brand Protection experts have highlighted three key issues online:</p>



<ul type="1" class="branded-bullet-list"><li>1. Listings for COVID vaccines on B2B and B2C marketplaces</li><li>2. Criminals selling COVID-related products – including fake vaccine passports, ID cards, and test results</li><li>3. Fake social media pages using COVID vaccine brand names</li></ul>



<p>Law enforcement agencies such as Interpol have been actively investigating vaccination scams online and enforcing on behalf of pharmaceutical brands. However, they are unable to take on bad actors alone. Stronger collaboration between platforms, lawmakers, public health bodies, and brands is needed to safeguard consumers.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-1-listings-for-covid-vaccines-on-b2b-and-b2c-marketplaces">1. Listings for COVID vaccines on B2B and B2C marketplaces</h2>



<p>According to cyber security researchers, the number of adverts seen for vaccines on hacking forums and other marketplaces has tripled to more than 1,200 since January<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>



<p>Incopro’s experts have detected several unauthorized listings claiming to be ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Direct Suppliers’ on B2B platforms EC21, Ecplaza, and Tradekey. With the listings not directly referring to branded vaccines, identifying the key platforms sellers use to advertise these fake or unauthorized products plays a significant role in proactive enforcement.</p>

<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>COVID vaccine listings can often also be found on B2C platforms such as eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist. These usually involve sellers offering slots to get the vaccine. COVID vaccine manufacturers have confirmed to Incopro that the majority of these online offers are scams.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Examples of unauthorized listings on B2C marketplaces</p>



<p>In February 2021, authorities in China arrested the leader of a multi-million-dollar vaccine scam. The individual responsible had researched the packaging designs of legitimate vaccines before producing over 58,000 solutions that simply contained saline solution and mineral water<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>. Alarmingly, a batch of the fake vaccines were smuggled overseas, and their destination is still unknown.</p>



<p>It is critical that platforms work with brands to have these types of listings removed swiftly. As long as vaccine listings remain visible on a platform, consumers are put at serious risk of being scammed, damage is being inflicted on the vaccine manufacturers’ brand, and global vaccination programs are in danger of being undermined by queue cutting.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-2-criminals-selling-covid-related-products">2. Criminals selling COVID-related products</h2>



<p>With plans for vaccine passports and identity cards to be adopted in the months ahead, some bad actors are looking to get ahead of the game. Fake identity cards, vaccine passports/certificates, and even test results are being sold on e-commerce websites and, increasingly, the dark web[3].</p>



<p>These types of fake goods are particularly dangerous, as unscrupulous individuals could use them to fraudulently gain access to COVID-secure venues and to travel abroad &#8211; with the real risk they could be carrying the virus.</p>



<p>Law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Drug Agency in the US (FDA) are pursuing false COVID-related products and are notifying registrars when their services are used by bad actors. However, with over 1,000 COVID-related domains being registered per day[4], registrars need to do more; they should not be waiting to be notified by brand owners or law enforcement before acting.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-3-fake-social-media-pages-using-covid-vaccine-brand-names">3. Fake social media pages using COVID vaccine brand names</h2>



<p>In October 2020<em>, </em>Incopro’s experts identified a private ‘investment study’ group on Facebook with over 1000 members using a vaccine manufacturers brand name. As this type of social media activity is not authorized, it is important to remove these pages to ensure that only factual information regarding the vaccines is circulated.</p>



<p>Other fake social media pages have been set up with the sole intention of scamming consumers. In August 2020, the HMRC (UK) reported it was currently investigating over 10,000 COVID-related phishing scams[5].</p>



<p>Fake social media pages with COVID vaccine brand names have also be set up with the intention of spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. It is critical that platforms are able to identify and remove these groups before they contribute irreversible damage to public health and trust in global vaccination programs.</p>



<p>Incopro’s experts have even come across instances of fake social media accounts set impersonating members of leadership teams at vaccine manufacturers, with the intention of gleaning sensitive business information.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-platforms-have-a-key-role-to-play">Platforms have a key role to play</h2>



<p>While listings for fake vaccines and other illegitimate COVID-related products are eventually removed, marketplaces have been criticised for being acting too slowly, thus putting consumers and brands at risk.</p>



<p>Throughout the pandemic, social media platforms have also come under fire for their slow removal of vaccine and COVID-19 disinformation (false or misleading information that is deliberately created / shared to cause harm[6]). Recently, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have publicly committed to stricter controls on COVID disinformation &#8211; and misinformation (false or misleading information that is unwittingly created or shared without meaning to cause harm[7]).</p>



<p>In March, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed US lawmakers&nbsp;on the variety of tools deployed by the social media platform to prevent harmful misinformation about COVID-19 from spreading. During the last 12 months, Facebook has partnered with over 60 global health experts to provide accurate information surrounding COVID-19 and vaccines. In December 2020, the platform announced that all vaccine misinformation would be banned. Users who violate the policy will be suspended and eventually banned if they continue to flout the rules<sup>[8]</sup>.</p>



<p>However, certain types of misinformation that is shared by individual accounts rather than large groups &#8211; such as personal anecdotes on vaccine side-effects and effectiveness – pose a grey area to platforms. This misinformation is usually left unmoderated without public health warnings attached.</p>



<p>With roughly <strong>30%</strong> of Americans&nbsp;continuing to express some hesitancy around getting a COVID vaccine<sup>[9]</sup>, platforms, lawmakers, public health bodies, and vaccine manufacturers need to work together to tackle disinformation, misinformation, and fake COVID products.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-can-pharmaceutical-brands-do">What can pharmaceutical brands do?</h2>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>In good news for brand owners, 2020 holiday spending reached an eye watering $100 billion by December in the US alone [1]. However, e-commerce events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday continue to be targeted by copycats, impersonators and counterfeiters who exploit spikes in consumer demand.</strong></p>



<p>These sales figures should be understood as part of a trend; e-commerce growth continues at rapid pace, with brick-and-mortar footfall decimated by the ongoing effects of COVID-19. In 2020, e-commerce tore up previous predictions and grew by <strong>30%</strong> in the US[2]. This is a new high for online sales, and a level not previously predicted until 2022.</p>



<p>In this piece, we detail our findings on brand exploitation during Black Friday 2020 and illustrate why a comprehensive Brand Protection strategy is needed to ensure your business can succeed as the world rapidly shifts online.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Brand exploiter behavior during Black Friday</h2>



<p>Brand exploiters hide their fake products among genuine discounted goods and are therefore able to mask low pricing that would usually raise eyebrows. Even to the savviest of consumers, counterfeits become difficult to identify within a sea of constantly changing offers and flash-sales.</p>



<p>With <strong>55%</strong> of consumers begin their online shopping searches on Amazon’s site [3] – brand owners are immediately put at a disadvantage by brand exploiters operating on marketplaces during sale events.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Black Friday 2020: Rampant brand exploitation on large e-commerce platforms</h2>



<p>The holidays are a particularly prolific time for brand exploiters. With 2020&#8217;s record-high online shopping volumes, counterfeit listings and sales are spiking. For example, in the week of Thanksgiving / run up to Black Friday / Cyber Monday 2020, compared to a week 3 months back, Incopro’s technology detected:</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Why platforms need to do more</h2>



<p>Many platforms have measures in place to facilitate the removal of brand exploiters. However, these tools offer varied results and do not provide enough coverage to make a lasting impact.</p>



<h3 id="h-amazon-brand-registry-not-providing-peace-of-mind-to-brands">Amazon – Brand Registry not providing peace of mind to brands</h3>



<p>The platform’s Brand Protection program “Brand Registry” is characterized by slow and inadequate responses to brand exploitation. Inconsistencies in the processing time for similar or identical violations also create a headache for brand owners. This means cases often need to be escalated – this additional step is burdensome and far more inconsistent than the initial reporting process.<br><br>Furthermore, Amazon often prevents brand owners from reporting violations if the rate of successful enforcement is deemed too low, and subsequently demand that a test purchase is conducted as evidence.</p>



<h3 id="h-ebay-inconsistent-responses-to-enforcement-and-declining-compliance">eBay – Inconsistent responses to enforcement and declining compliance</h3>



<p>eBay too suffers from inconsistent and slow responses to enforcement. It has also recently shown a decline in overall compliance. Practices towards similar or identical reported listings vary enormously across territories. And to add further frustration, explanations for notice rejections are frequently inconsistent, incorrect, or missing altogether, requiring multiple follow-ups.</p>



<p>Such issues extend to notices regarding breaches of the platform’s own policy, which covers soon-to-expire and expired products or products missing expiry dates, particularly in relation to medication, foodstuffs, and other consumable goods.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-can-brands-do">What can brands do?</h2>



<p>It is essential that brands monitor brand exploitation trends in the run-up to Black Friday. For each high-priority platform, you should have a comprehensive strategy in place. Our proposed strategy for Amazon during the holiday season is as follows:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Monitor the buy box on your listings closely (up to 82% of all Amazon sales go through the buy box [4])</li><li>Proactively defend your brand on Amazon by signing up to Brand Registry and ‘gate’ high-priority ASINs (the ASIN is the unique offer identifier on Amazon &#8211; it poses difficulty to brand owners because Amazon requires all listings for a single product to be located on the same ASIN page)</li><li>Monitor non-gated authorized ASINs and look for duplicates</li></ol>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Amazon’s Brand Registry</strong>&nbsp;offers tools to help brands manage their presence on the marketplace and to remove infringing products, including:</p>



<ul><li>Bulk enforcement of counterfeit ASINs</li><li>Merging duplicate ASINs</li></ul>



<p><strong><br>ASIN gating</strong>&nbsp;refers to the practice of ‘locking’ authorized ASINs so that only a select list of verified sellers can operate on it. Brands should be aware that it is only available to those enrolled in the Brand Registry. It is a paid service and is reserved for a select number of your listings.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-comprehensive-year-round-strategy">A comprehensive year-round strategy</h3>



<p>Earlier, we mentioned that growth in e-commerce is not isolated to sales event but is part of a long-term trend that has been accelerated by COVID-19. In a post-pandemic world, you’ll need a comprehensive strategy that protects your consumers and revenue streams online.</p>



<p>Noting the limitations of platforms tools, collaboration with platforms is still core to building this strategy. Where&nbsp;your consumers shop and&nbsp;who&nbsp;they purchase from are important considerations when choosing the platforms that you prioritize and develop robust relationships with.</p>



<p>Once you’ve decided the key platforms in which to focus your efforts, you should seek to engage with them directly or through a trusted partner. The following approach should be considered as part of your relationship building exercise:</p>



<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts within the platforms’ support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;</li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;</li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;and interact with the relevant representatives where the platform has local websites</li></ul>



<p>As alluded to, there is only so much you can achieve without a technology solution. A critical component of a comprehensive strategy is sophisticated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectiontechnology">Brand Protection technology</a>&nbsp;that works in tandem with platform tools but also:</p>



<ul><li>Collects more data on the individuals exploiting your brand</li><li>Prioritizes high-risk listings that your consumers are most likely to find</li><li>Makes the connection between brand exploiters operating across multiple channels and regions</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Brand Protection technology is critical</h2>



<p>Talisman, Incopro’s Brand Protection platform, is a complete tool that ensures that businesses have all the data they need related to brand exploitation, including the risk posed by infringing listings and a view of the networks of criminals targeting their brands. Once gathered, Talisman provides the means for seamless enforcement against brand exploiters.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The business models and tactics deployed to hijack businesses&#8217; digital channels have become increasingly sophisticated – it’s critical that your team is equipped with the tools and knowledge to remain one step ahead.</strong></p>



<p>In a poll of Brand Protection professionals <strong>69%</strong> stated that when planning their strategy, they either haven’t considered the business models of bad actors or find it hard to understand / get visibility of them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="414" height="268" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Poll-results-Planning-Brand-Protection-strategy-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11719" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Poll-results-Planning-Brand-Protection-strategy-1.png 414w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Poll-results-Planning-Brand-Protection-strategy-1-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></figure>



<p>By building an understanding of bad actors&#8217; operating models and uncovering their online networks, brands can maintain consumer trust and maximize the opportunity offered by&nbsp;e-commerce.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" style="color:#009ca6">Part 1:&nbsp;The threats posed by bad actors online to your business and its consumers</h2>



<p>The business models deployed by bad actors most often mimic those of legitimate businesses.&nbsp;Bad actors will also often share the same strategic considerations when they go to market and promote products, utilizing the same digital channels and tools.</p>



<p>The changing online and commercial environment changes the way they adapt, like any business.&nbsp;This is also true when enforcement activity changes their behavior.</p>



<h3 id="h-seasonal-trend-and-enforcement-based-changes-in-bad-actors-behavior">Seasonal, trend, and enforcement-based changes in bad actors’ behavior</h3>



<p>Bad actors’ behavior is constantly changing in response to events that can impact their sales and ability to operate.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“Changes&nbsp;I commonly observe&nbsp;can be&nbsp;based on similar things to legitimate business: seasons/holidays/trends in the social environment. Bad actors also&nbsp;change as a reaction to&nbsp;enforcement.”</strong></p><cite>Alex Shad, Brand Protection Team Lead, Incopro</cite></blockquote>



<p>With Seasonal events such as Easter, Halloween, and Christmas, bad actors will emulate genuine brand behavior&nbsp;on social media, marketplaces, and websites. With cases of phishing, fraud, and impersonation, bad actors attempt to make their social posts and websites appear genuine to trick consumers. They will also combine this with the use of redirects and other entities that look legitimate to divert consumers.</p>



<p>Bad actors will also react to the social climate. For example, they started producing face masks&nbsp;during the coronavirus pandemic – as seen <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/how-agile-infringer-networks-restructure-and-avoid-enforcement/">in this network example</a>.</p>



<p>Enforcement is also a key driver, with behavior depending on issue type:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fraud/impersonation</strong> – enforcement is more likely to&nbsp;scare bad actors into hiding. They will depopulate&nbsp;enforceable pages and then repopulate&nbsp;very quickly without notice&nbsp;to disseminate scams. They may also set up personal profiles to later populate if they are expecting enforcement on pages that are currently live.</li><li><strong>Traditional trademark infringement</strong> – After enforcement, bad actors&nbsp;are more likely to change the way in which they infringe as opposed to changing their business model. The seller may blur over the infringing elements&nbsp;of images or&nbsp;appear to cease the sale of certain products.</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-bad-actors-are-often-agile-operators-that-adopt-emerging-platforms"><strong>Bad actors are often agile operators that adopt emerging platforms</strong></h3>



<p>Bad actors can be more dynamic than legitimate businesses at entering new markets and deploying new technology as they have lower barriers to entry. Counterfeiters, in particular, make use of new emerging platforms and have used influencer culture to their advantage.</p>



<p>TikTok, a user-generated content (UGC) platform that has enjoyed huge growth over the last year, is a good example – it has seen over 2 billion downloads in it’s first 4 years since launch, with Q1 2020 seeing over 315m&nbsp;downloads alone. TikTok’s primary audience is younger consumers, who are quicker to adopt newer media formats. Bad actors have latched onto this platform and often use influencers, who lend an aura of authenticity, to promote their goods to large swathes of consumers.</p>



<h3 id="h-bad-actors-are-one-step-ahead-in-reacting-to-market-trends">Bad actors are one step ahead in reacting to market trends</h3>



<p>Bad actors will also often be one step ahead of legitimate companies in reacting to market trends. An example of this is product unboxing videos – bad actors sometimes enlist the help of prominent influencers on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube to unbox their counterfeit products, highlighting key features and build quality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="650" height="427" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Example-of-counterfeit-unboxing-on-YouTube.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11723" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Example-of-counterfeit-unboxing-on-YouTube.jpg 650w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Example-of-counterfeit-unboxing-on-YouTube-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure>



<p>When reacting to wider market trends, they do not adhere to rules, regulations, or legal frameworks, meaning they can create and market new product lines far faster than legitimate companies.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" style="color:#009ca6">Part 2:&nbsp;The models used to capture consumers, and how to disrupt them&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We will look at 3 different types of network to illustrate how&nbsp;they are structured and how you can tackle them:&nbsp;</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Simple network: marketplace seller connected by WeChat&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Traditional counterfeiting&nbsp;network&nbsp;selling luxury watches</li><li>Multichannel network selling flavored vaping liquids&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h3 id="h-1-simple-network-shopee-storefronts-seller-connected-by-wechat">1. Simple network – Shopee storefronts seller connected by WeChat</h3>



<p>In this example, Incopro analysts discovered a network selling counterfeit goods that pose a health risk to consumers.</p>



<p><strong>Key features of the network:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Marketplace seller found to be offering infringing items which posed a health risk to consumers</li><li>WeChat ID connected the account to 32 other storefronts on the same platform</li><li>Auditing these connected storefronts could reveal further issues for the brand</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="366" height="335" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11730" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-1.png 366w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-1-300x275.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></figure>



<p>The network is comprised of multiple&nbsp;Shopee storefronts all connected by one single WeChat account&nbsp;– without using <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/whiteboard/network-analysis/">Network Analysis technology</a>, these storefronts would have been encountered one by one without&nbsp;the&nbsp;link ever being made,&nbsp;removing the possibility for&nbsp;coordinated enforcement causing max disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using this link, Incopro analysts can search and ‘audit’ each linked storefront and screen&nbsp;these for similar infringements or references to the relevant brands.&nbsp;If other infringements are found, these can be collected for enforcement as one notice through the Shopee webform.&nbsp;An additional benefit of&nbsp;coordinated enforcement on individual sellers is the increased chance the platform would proactively deactivate the whole storefront.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-large-scale-network-selling-counterfeit-luxury-watch-network">2. Large-scale network selling counterfeit luxury watch network</h3>



<p>In this example, Incopro discovered a typical counterfeiting network offering luxury watches predominantly via websites. The network was multinational in nature,&nbsp;with a global supply chain which centered on China.</p>



<p><strong>Key features of the network:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Large scale network containing 216 websites connected by 8 common email addresses (3 China-based and 5 international)</li><li>These networks primarily use traditional search methods to attract traffic&nbsp;</li><li>Targeted multiple brands owned by a number of different businesses, indicating a broad network (other brands targeted: Rolex, Breitling, Timberland, UGG)</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="378" height="370" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11726" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-2.png 378w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-2-300x294.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></figure>



<p>Coordinated action against all of the entities within the network is one method to effectively disrupt&nbsp;its operation. With most of the network’s customers arriving via organic search, Google’s URL delisting tool could also come in to play to starve the network of its traffic source. Equally, due to the large scale of the network, offline action with legal partners would also be an effective strategy to tackle the perpetrators.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-multichannel-network-selling-vaping-products">3. Multichannel Network&nbsp;selling vaping products </h3>



<p>In this example, vaping liquid products were sold via websites and marketplaces with promotional pages on social media.</p>



<p><strong>Key features of the network:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Complex network with multiple storefronts and websites</li><li>Domains&nbsp;connected by&nbsp;a&nbsp;company&nbsp;that supports website &amp; online store set up and synchronization</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="399" height="284" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11732" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-3.png 399w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-3-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></figure>



<p>Connections made by Network Analysis technology allow for all marketplace listings, social media posts, and domain URLs to be enforced at once, leaving the bad actor with no opportunity to change product listings. The Domains&nbsp;that are connected by&nbsp;the website set-up company&nbsp;can then be forwarded to the Investigations Services team to build further intelligence.</p>



<h3 id="h-incopro-case-study-offline-action-disrupting-counterfeit-jewelry-network-in-china">Incopro Case Study: Offline action disrupting counterfeit jewelry network in China</h3>



<p>One core avenue to dismantling bad actor networks is coordinated offline action in liaison with local authorities and law enforcement agencies.</p>



<p>In 2018, a counterfeiting&nbsp;ring that peddled high-value&nbsp;jewelry&nbsp;(average&nbsp;price $8,000) across popular online marketplaces was discovered by Incopro’s analysts. Test-purchases&nbsp;were used to gather identifying information on the perpetrators, with the wider case being built using&nbsp;data gathered from Taobao, Weibo, and WeChat. Subsequent offline action led to over 50&nbsp;arrests and seizure of products across seven&nbsp;addresses.</p>



<p>Multilateral action is key&nbsp;to more effective offline action. In China, the close relationship between CBBC (China Britain Business Council) and platforms such as Alibaba now make offline investigations easier to undertake.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" style="color:#009ca6">Part 3:&nbsp;How Network Analysis technology can help you address these threats effectively&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/network-analysis/">Network Analysis</a> is a core module of Incopro’s Brand Protection platform <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Talisman</a> that powers a strategic approach to tackling networks.&nbsp;By connecting infringing entities across channels such as websites, marketplaces, and social media – and matching them against online and offline identifiers – Network Analysis gives you full visibility of the risks to your brands, prioritizes them by threat level, and provides you with the insights to act on them at scale.</p>



<p><strong>There are four key components to Incopro’s Network Analysis technology that enable you to tackle the most damaging threats to your business:</strong></p>



<h4 id="h-1-good-quality-data-meaningful-networks">1. GOOD QUALITY DATA = MEANINGFUL NETWORKS</h4>



<ul><li>Processes for cleaning and validating data before networks are built</li><li>Algorithms to make networks more meaningful, e.g. take out nodes with too many links</li><li>All useful data points extracted, both structured and unstructured</li><li>Inferred links based on similarities – helps uncover potentially connected nodes</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-2-contextualized-threats-in-the-universe-of-networks">2. CONTEXTUALIZED THREATS IN THE ‘UNIVERSE’ OF NETWORKS</h4>



<ul><li>Threat score to prioritize and assess each network</li><li>Take into account popularity, action taken and the risk from the network’s component parts</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-3-tools-to-search-manipulate-and-edit">3. TOOLS TO SEARCH, MANIPULATE AND EDIT</h4>



<ul><li>Search and filter clusters on a wide variety of data points</li><li>Compare networks to understand the bigger picture</li><li>Add and remove nodes and links to build out your online and offline intelligence picture</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-4-impactful-enforcement-from-the-network-view">4. IMPACTFUL ENFORCEMENT FROM THE NETWORK VIEW</h4>



<ul><li>Identify key enablers to dismantle all or part of the network, as your strategy directs</li><li>Tackle the whole network and see how it responds&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-when-to-use-network-analysis-within-your-workflow">When to use Network Analysis within your workflow</h3>



<p>The tool&nbsp;has the potential to be used&nbsp;as both&nbsp;a&nbsp;principal&nbsp;resource for online action and a supplementary&nbsp;resource for further enforcement.&nbsp;Brand owners can filter through high-risk networks&nbsp;and networks that include tagged objects.&nbsp;This includes checking connections made with official entities.</p>



<p>Brand owners can then screen, tag and enforce infringements outside of the tool&nbsp;and then filter for those tags and enforcements in Network Analysis. This can open the door to a possible string of previously unseen connections and sellers to be targeted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is beneficial if&nbsp;a team needs to focus on multiple online issues&nbsp;at any one time. It is also useful where issues are more ‘trends’&nbsp;that spread across a number of sellers and are therefore not specific to a single bad actor.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;novel issues or&nbsp;issues&nbsp;where sellers are known to change their behavior quickly, the preferred workflow would be enforcing all infringing items in a network at once.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Request a demo</h2>



<p>Network Analysis gives you insight&nbsp;into the&nbsp;different&nbsp;networks&nbsp;that are&nbsp;hijacking your brand and exploiting consumers.&nbsp;By building a full picture of these networks&nbsp;and prioritizing based on threat, we can&nbsp;drive&nbsp;enforcement&nbsp;and investigations&nbsp;in a more strategic,&nbsp;impactful way.</p>
