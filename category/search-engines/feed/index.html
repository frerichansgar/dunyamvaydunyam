<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Brand Protection stretches beyond removing fake listings on marketplaces, impersonating posts on social media, and illegitimate website domains. You also need to pay attention to how your brand is presented legitimately across your key digital channels.</strong></p>



<p>Dormant or unmanaged assets on social media or domains often clog up online search results, causing consumers confusing&amp; diverting potential customers seeking to engage; if you neglect these assets you are effectively competing against yourself. Add online bad actors and your actual competitors to the mix and suddenly, retaining a strong brand identity and ensuring reliable online consumer experience becomes increasingly difficult.</p>



<p>This is why monitoring your digital footprint is key to your brand’s success online. In this piece, we walk you through the use cases, the outcomes you can deliver, and the methods for getting control of your digital footprint. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-is-your-digital-footprint">What is your digital footprint?</h2>



<p>Your digital footprint is your brand’s full online presence – ranging from social media accounts and individual pages on your company’s e-commerce website, to the product &amp; wider brand imagery you deploy online.</p>



<p>There is limited digital real estate – you are vying for a finite number of spots on the first page of search results. Without effective monitoring of your digital footprint, you run the risk that consumers are directed to outdated brand assets or exposed to defunct messaging that doesn’t align with current marketing campaigns.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-are-the-use-cases-for-monitoring-your-digital-footprint">What are the use cases for monitoring your digital footprint?</h2>



<p>The larger your business, the more agencies you engage, and the more territories that you operate in, the more brand assets, social accounts, and general ‘bloat’ associated with your brand is going to be visible online.</p>



<p>Here are two key use cases for monitoring digital footprint:</p>



<h3 id="h-1-rebranding-changing-brand-messaging-imagery-other-assets">1. Rebranding – changing brand messaging, imagery &amp; other assets</h3>



<p>With more ways than ever to promote products and services across the digital ecosystem and an increasing list of markets targeted, the volume of assets hosted across e-commerce websites, social channels, and by third-party sellers is always expanding.</p>



<p>Brand messaging will often change in response to evolving consumer behaviors or in order reach new consumers and markets. When engaging in a rebranding exercise or introducing new messaging / imagery, it is critical that you can identify and remedy old assets across your key digital channels.</p>



<h4 id="h-case-study-unilever">Case study: Unilever</h4>



<p>Leading FMCG company Unilever engaged in a rebranding exercise with one of its global beauty brands.</p>



<p>With Incopro’s technology, Unilever’s brand team was able to identify that nearly <strong>80%</strong> of the images that were still being broadcast online were from old marketing packs and no longer relevant to the brand.</p>



<p>This enabled Unilever’s team to isolate past digital assets content and remove it from websites, marketplaces, and social media platforms to prevent consumer confusion.</p>

</div>


<h3 id="h-2-social-media-audit-regaining-control-of-lost-active-or-dormant-accounts">2. Social media audit &#8211; regaining control of lost active or dormant accounts</h3>



<p>A Social Media Audit is the process of reviewing all&nbsp;social&nbsp;media entities associated with a brand&nbsp;(or brands)&nbsp;to&nbsp;create a managed inventory of active accounts to drive better consumer experience.</p>



<p>By monitoring your digital footprint, you can flag dormant or rogue social media accounts for removal and recover lost accounts and their followers.</p>



<h4 id="h-case-study-mondel-z-international">Case study: Mondelēz International</h4>



<p>Following a social media audit, global snacking company Mondelēz International used Incopro’s technology to identify social media accounts previously run by external agencies and internal regional teams that were no longer under central control of the company and posed a risk to brand reputation.</p>



<p>It was key that these accounts were either brought under central control or removed to protect their online consumer experience.</p>



<p>During this exercise, Mondelēz also used Incopro’s technology to identify all unofficial accounts that were trying to affiliate themselves with the company and lined them up for enforcement action.</p>

</div>


<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-are-the-outcomes-of-cleaning-your-digital-footprint">What are the outcomes of cleaning your digital footprint?</h2>



<ul><li>Better use of digital spend, more effective marketing campaigns, and increased traffic to new products/website content</li><li>Aligned brand messaging across markets, preventing consumer confusion &amp; diversion, and increased consumer trust</li><li>More control of consumer experience across a known inventory of owned digital touchpoints</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-how-to-get-control-of-your-digital-footprint">How to get control of your digital footprint</h2>



<p>You’ve heard some of the use cases and the outcomes a successful strategy will deliver. Now time for the million-dollar question: “how do you monitor, clean &amp; get control of your digital footprint”?</p>



<p>A combination of a Brand Protection technology solution and subject matter&nbsp;expertise&nbsp;is needed to overcome issues&nbsp;flagged during your digital footprint audit.</p>



<p>Consumers take an omnichannel view to engaging with brands online so you need technology to present a holistic, analyzed view of your brand online across all digital channels. Added to this you need expertise in regaining control of your brand to focus on active authorized digital assets, and then isolate or remove outdated, or otherwise irrelevant assets that are detracting from your brand’s image.</p>



<p>With this approach, you can deliver a managed inventory of your online assets for better control of brand standards and consumer experience.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-identify-affected-digital-assets">1. Identify affected digital assets</h3>



<p>Using sophisticated keyword and image matching technology, you can scour all channels for accounts, social pages, web pages, and other assets that use your branding. This is a useful exercise to understand the extent of the problem and opportunity for control for Marketing and Brand Protection teams.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-regain-control-of-or-remove-assets">2. Regain control of or remove assets</h3>



<p>Combining this technology solution with the expertise from your Brand Protection Analyst team, you can regain full control of your wanted authorised assets, protecting followers and footfall. &nbsp;Wanted assets not currently under your brand’s direct control can be recovered, or if the assets are no longer required or are unauthorized, you can have these removed.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-talisman-enterprise-brand-protection-technology">Talisman – Enterprise Brand Protection technology</h2>



<p>Alongside sophisticated text, image &amp; logo matching technology, Talisman uses advanced capabilities including Network Analysis, to identify &amp; analyze all digital touchpoints whether owned or unauthorized. All of this takes place in a single platform from which all remediation and enforcement actions are delivered. &nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Google has long been accused of turning a blind eye towards websites that offer counterfeits or otherwise infringe trademarks. The search engine giant’s historical stance was to resist de-indexing requests, only relenting once a court order was obtained by a brand owner.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Now, Google has shifted its stance and launched a de-indexing tool for trademark infringements – but does this tool go far enough?</strong></p>



<p>Since the publication of our data-led research paper, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/how-and-why-search-engines-must-take-responsibility-for-tackling-counterfeiters/">‘Search engines: Time to step up&#8217;</a>, Incopro has been lobbying Google to do more to protect consumers and brands from counterfeits.<br><br>In a recent policy change, Google announced that they will now de-index links to individual webpages that list counterfeits when notified. However, they will not de-index entire websites dedicated to selling fakes.<br><br>In this piece, we share the insights from our recent webinar <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/webinar-website-enforcement/">‘Website Enforcement: Does Google’s Policy Change Deliver for Brands?</a>’, with key quotes from our panelists: Simon Baggs, CEO and Co-Founder at <strong>Incopro</strong>, Måns Sjöstrand, Head of IP &amp; Brand Protection at <strong>Daniel Wellington</strong>;&nbsp;Rachel Alexander, Partner in the IP Litigation Group at <strong>Wiggin</strong>; and Mike Sweeney, Senior Legal Counsel at&nbsp;<strong>Incopro</strong>. Read to learn the background behind the policy change, what this change means for brands, and why Google still needs to go further.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-1-website-infringement-the-problem-and-challenges-for-brands" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>Part 1:&nbsp;Website infringement – the problem and challenges for brands&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Website infringement refers to the unauthorized use of intellectual property on a webpage/website or within a domain name.</p>



<p>It continues to put consumers at risk, inflict damage on digital revenues, and erode brand reputation. This issue is only exacerbated by search engines, with links to websites that offer counterfeit goods appearing prominently in search results &#8211; an average of<strong> 56.3%</strong> of traffic to these sites arrives via organic search[1].</p>



<p>Indeed, up to&nbsp;<strong>60%</strong>&nbsp;of product results returned by search engines are for websites and other online locations that offer products that are either counterfeit or otherwise infringe intellectual property[2].</p>



<p>Search engines are also intrinsically linked to infringements found on other channels such as marketplaces and social media, with results pages, social posts, and individual listings indexed within search results.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-key-threats-to-brands"><strong>The key threats to brands</strong></h3>



<p>Website infringement presents&nbsp;several critical challenges&nbsp;to businesses, such as:&nbsp;</p>



<ul type="1"><li><strong>High risk of consumer confusion</strong> – Bad actors create mirror sites resembling official sites to trick consumers, use SEO engineering to boost search ranks, and promote phishing websites to steal data.</li><li><strong>Difficult enforcement in comparison to social media and marketplaces</strong> – Brand owners face longer response times, uncompliant hosts/registrars, and infringers that migrate from host to host. UDRP and court actions are often required.</li><li><strong>Managing vast domain name portfolios</strong> &#8211; Brands are also often pushed to invest in domain name portfolios going far beyond practical business needs in order to try to proactively limit risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-daniel-wellington-case-study-dwstore-ru-dwbutik-ru"><strong>Daniel Wellington case study: dwstore.ru / dwbutik.ru&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>In the webinar Måns Sjöstrand, Head of IP &amp; Brand Protection at <strong>Daniel Wellington</strong>, shared an example of two websites &#8211; dwstore.ru and dwbutik.ru &#8211; that were wholly dedicated to counterfeiting and were mirroring Daniel Wellington’s official site.</p>



<p>These websites were top ranking on Google and Yandex Russia&nbsp;searches. The Russia-based website host&nbsp;was non-responsive, and the identity of the infringer was initially unknown, complicating enforcement efforts.</p>



<p>The continued operation of the infringing websites represented de facto competition to Daniel Wellington’s local e-commerce&nbsp;performance.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-normal-font-size"><em>From left to right: Screenshots of dwstore.ru and dwbutik.ru</em></p>



<p>Legal actions against the host, and later against the website owner, were required. With the previous stance taken by Google, a brand owner would need to await first instance court judgement before webpages would be de-indexed. A second instance judgement in turn would be needed for&nbsp;the host to&nbsp;act.</p>



<p>With Google’s Legal Shooter form now supporting notices for trademark infringement, Daniel Wellington was able to de-index from search results <strong>70</strong> individual URLs. Further action brought the two domains under the brand owner’s control – if the domains are visited now, they will redirect to Daniel Wellington’s official Russian website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full clear-bottom"><img width="1394" height="591" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Daniel-Wellington-Website-enforcement.png" alt="Daniel Wellington - Website enforcement" class="wp-image-10395" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Daniel-Wellington-Website-enforcement.png 1394w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Daniel-Wellington-Website-enforcement-300x127.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Daniel-Wellington-Website-enforcement-1024x434.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Daniel-Wellington-Website-enforcement-768x326.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1394px) 100vw, 1394px" /></figure>



<p>In a recent poll of Brand Protection experts, a staggering <strong>83%</strong> stated that when website takedown requests are sent to hosts and registrars most are not actioned, and those that are actioned are easily circumnavigated by infringers – the websites move quickly and re-appear elsewhere. This suggests the current system for enforcing against website infringements is inherently flawed and ineffective for brand owners.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-2-google-s-historic-position-on-tackling-fake-websites-why-it-needed-to-change" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>PART 2:&nbsp;Google’s historic position on tackling fake websites – why it needed to change&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Rachel&nbsp;Alexander, Partner in the IP Litigation Group, Wiggin, states that Google’s historic position was simply to refuse to remove search links leading to counterfeit-selling websites or webpages.</p>



<p>The platform stated, <strong>“Google does not at this time de-index URLs or websites from its Web Search index on trademark grounds upon request.”</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this approach to trademark infringement was highly inconsistent with other areas:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Copyright:</strong> Google would de-index URLs that lead to copyright-infringing material&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Spam/phishing/malware:</strong>&nbsp;Google would remove scam websites from search results&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Google justified its position&nbsp;by stating that it was legally required to act in relation to reported copyright infringement under US law, but no such legislation existed requiring to remove trademark-infringing material.</p>



<p>Google also maintained that there were commercial drivers that it had to consider when ensuring utility of its search engine.</p>



<p>The search engine giant takes the view that it is not a “publisher” when notified of trademark infringements and therefore it denies that it has responsibility for harmful activities of others.</p>



<p>Google would only relent and act against an infringer once a court order was obtained by a brand owner.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-stark-contrast-between-host-providers-platforms-and-search-engines"><strong>The stark contrast between host providers /  platforms and search engines</strong></h3>



<p>Hosting platforms will&nbsp;act&nbsp;when notified of trademark infringements or counterfeit goods. There is a requirement for hosts to act “expeditiously to remove or to disable access to [illegal] information” once on notice. If they do not act swiftly, they may lose safe harbor protections and be sued for damages (See e.g., Art. 14, E-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC.)</p>



<p>Google’s stated intent, on the other hand, was to fight any attempt to use legal process to address trademark infringements.</p>



<h3 id="h-why-does-it-matter"><strong>Why does it matter?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Counterfeiting causes financial and reputational to brand owners, gives rise to wider social and economic impacts, and funds wider criminal activities.</p>



<p>The prevalence of websites selling counterfeit goods, including potentially harmful goods, also puts consumers at greater risk. And search engines play a decisive role in enabling the discovery of these dangerous websites and web pages.</p>



<p><strong>“[De-indexing]</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>simple, not very costly and within reach of a moderately experienced programmer” </strong>(Hamburg Regional Court, Max Mosley v Google Inc.)</p>



<p>In other contexts, intermediary injunctions are effective – there is the potential to ‘scale-up’ and tackle operators with global reach. There is a need for a “multi-pronged” approach&nbsp;and greater collaboration between search engines and brand owners.</p>



<p>In a recent poll of Brand Protection experts, an overwhelming majority<strong> (83%)</strong> believe that the law in the US and Europe should change to require Google to do more. This supports the argument that brand owners feel regulatory pressure is the best means of enacting change – in many cases, platforms still refuse to go above and beyond what the law requires of them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-bottom"><img width="378" height="181" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Poll-Should-the-law-in-the-US-Europe-change.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10399" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Poll-Should-the-law-in-the-US-Europe-change.png 378w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Poll-Should-the-law-in-the-US-Europe-change-300x144.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></figure>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-3-google-s-new-policy-what-has-changed-and-what-brands-need-to-know" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>PART 3:&nbsp;Google’s new policy – what has changed and what brands need to know&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In June, Google significantly shifted its policy &#8211; Court Orders are no longer required to notify Google of trademark infringements&nbsp;and have them removed from search results.</p>



<p>Brands concerned about trademark infringing webpages appearing in organic search can now notify Google using the Legal Shooter Form.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-good-news">The good news&nbsp;</h3>



<ul><li>It is encouraging to see Google responding to lobbying pressure&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The Legal Shooter Form represents a new weapon for brands to use in website enforcement &#8211; especially against uncompliant hosts and registrars. It is worth noting that successfully using the tool does not remove infringing websites from the internet.&nbsp;</li><li>There is a sense of “levelling-up”&nbsp;trademarks&nbsp;in line with copyright.&nbsp;</li><li>The new solution is more cost effective – brands do not need to seek a Court Order to have individual webpages removed</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-the-bad-news">The bad news&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<ul><li>Google will still only evaluate notices on a&nbsp;URL by URL basis – entire websites cannot be deindexed</li><li>This is true even for websites which self-declare as infringing and serve no legitimate purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Does very little to alleviate the strain on brands whose budgets are already under pressure. A small number of websites can comprise over <strong>100,000&nbsp;URLs</strong>.</li><li>There are several practical limitations – The form only supports Gmail&nbsp;accounts and requires screenshot evidence for every notice, further increasing the effort required to send each notice.</li></ul>



<p>In a recent poll of Brand Protection experts, a <strong>33%</strong> stated that they believed the tool is not scalable and therefore will only use it rarely. This further supports Incopro’s argument that Google must go further in tackling counterfeits.</p>



<p>Interestingly, <strong>43% </strong>stated that they intend to use the tool going forward. We also support this stance – it will enable brand owners to work out whether the tool can be used effectively and allow them to provide feedback to Google on how it can be improved. It also stops the search giant from rightfully claiming that the tool is not being utilized and therefore refusing to invest time in improving the tool or further shifting their policy.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-4-further-change-is-needed-what-else-google-must-do-and-how-brands-can-collaborate-to-drive-this" style="color:#009ca6"><strong>Part 4: Further change is needed – what else Google must do and how brands can collaborate to drive this&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Google’s policy change is a step in the right direction – however it does not go far enough.</p>



<p>Incopro has campaigned for a scalable solution to tackle widespread infringement. Under this new system, trademark owners are still not able to have entire websites that are dedicated to selling counterfeits removed from search results – only individual pages.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-what-can-brands-do-now"><strong>What can brands do now?</strong></h3>



<p>Rachel Alexander affirms that there is well-established case law that brands can deploy to fight website infringement. Injunctions are increasingly targeting internet intermediaries such as ISPs using trademark rights – and in cases within France and Canada the term intermediary also refers to search engines.</p>



<p>Brand owners have previously used ISP blocking orders alongside de-indexing orders for copyright infringing content. This case law can be developed further by brand owners to target trademark infringements and to work in a flexible, scalable way.</p>



<p>Google must do more. As legislative and regulatory pressure on internet platforms intensifies, brands should seek to capitalize on the growing momentum and redouble efforts in pursuit of change.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Google has done something in response to pressures applied to it. Perhaps that gives an indication of its willingness to go further – I think that’s especially true if brands can lend their weight and support in future lobbying efforts.”</p><cite>Mike Sweeney, Senior Legal Counsel, Incopro</cite></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Counterfeit white goods can be found easily through search engines, putting consumer health and safety at grave risk.</h2>



<p>Incopro research reveals that websites offering these potentially dangerous counterfeits goods are often found on search engines, and brands currently have no easy means of having these indexed results removed.</p>



<p>Incopro is calling for search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yandex to do more to safeguard consumers from fakes before more stringent regulation is required.</p>



<h3>The dangers of counterfeit white goods</h3>



<p>Counterfeit parts can cause irreparable damage to expensive appliances. Even worse, appliance failure potentially can lead to electrical fires and&nbsp;deadly gas&nbsp;leaks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When making a purchase of white goods, consumers tend to rely on trusted brands and traditional supply chains &#8211; the complexity of these appliances makes it more difficult for infringers to fool consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The costs involved with manufacturing and distributing finished counterfeit appliances also creates a barrier to entry for bad actors.</p>



<p>However, it is replacement parts where the issue lies. Disreputable suppliers seek to fool cost-conscious consumers who search online for cheap replacement parts to extend the life of their white goods.</p>



<p>Fake replacement refrigerator parts such as water filters pose a danger to consumers, who rely on them to filter out contaminants &#8211; counterfeits are not up to this vital&nbsp;task.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Online sales of counterfeit refrigerator water filters are a rapidly growing problem. These counterfeit water filters are sold with misleading and fraudulent labelling, often including illegal use of brand names, logos, and product labels,”</em></p><cite>the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) warns in an online public awareness campaign(1).<br>&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p>The group’s independent tests of counterfeit water filters purchased from websites demonstrate the alarming dangers that consumers face from a mistaken purchase:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“[1] Counterfeit filters failed to remove harmful lead from household water. [2] Counterfeit filters failed to remove live cysts from household water. [3] Some counterfeit filters introduced harmful compounds into household water.”</em></p></blockquote>



<h3>The availability of fake replacement parts through search</h3>



<p>One counterfeit website identified by Incopro was ‘refrigerator-water-filters.com’. The website listed four brands (Whirlpool, Samsung, Kenmore and GE) in its page title to deliberately cause consumer confusion and helped it to appear in search engine results when consumers searched for those brands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All consumers arrived at this website via organic search. The top 5 keywords used to find the website were associated with genuine refrigerator water filter models: 69625-ct-001, aprilaire ffc20256sg, idylis es 12-id, ph21210 whir, and kohler k20852-na.35<sup>[2]</sup><br></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="363" height="214" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6532" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.png 363w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>When conducting a search using these search terms on Google.com, ‘refrigerator-water-filters.com’ appeared on&nbsp;the first page of results in 4 out of 5 searches.</p>



<p>Refrigerator-water-filters.com offered a variety of counterfeit brand name and fake replacement water filters that were likely neither safe nor actually compatible with the refrigerators. For example, it offered a filter that it described as a “Whirlpool EDR1RXD1” and another that was described as a “Maytag Puriclean III” alongside pictures of packaging and product that contained brand name logos. The AHAM research suggests that these water filters did not meet consumer water filtration safety standards, potentially exposing unsuspecting consumers to contaminants.</p>



<p>The ‘About Us’ section of the Refrigerator-water-filters.com website noted that the company was headquartered in China where “production and product development takes place”. From there, the products were shipped worldwide. Even though it claimed to produce and develop its own filters, it also falsely claimed that branded items were “original”.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="425" height="35" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6534" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-1.png 425w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-1-300x25.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left heading-branded bg-grey--light">Search Engines: Time to step up</h2>



<p>Concern about consumer safety should extend beyond brands and industry groups, as fake replacement parts continue to pose a clear and present danger. A concerted, joint effort is needed to protect consumers, with search engines at the forefront.</p>



<p>Brands are often powerless to act alone, as rogue counterfeit-supporting web hosts are uncooperative with website takedown requests.</p>



<p>Incopro calls for search engines such as Google to work with brands to establish a swift process to have counterfeit sites removed from results.</p>

<h2>According to new Incopro research, up to <strong>3 in 9</strong> first-page search results for branded baby teethers are for websites selling harmful or counterfeit products, posing danger to young children.</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Childrens-products_3-in-9-search-results-harmful_positive_RGB1.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>As total toy sales have slumped in the wake of the demise of US retail giant Toys “R” Us, ecommerce sales have been on the rise, representing a tectonic shift in the toy landscape.</p>



<p>Consumers now purchase toys from a wide array of relatively unknown online retailers, instead of trusted and well-established offline stores. They also purchase from marketplaces such as Amazon which, despite being widely regarded by consumers as a trustworthy platform, is known to contain thousands of counterfeit products.</p>



<p>Worryingly, consumers are increasingly being exposed to counterfeit toys and baby products on search engines in the run-up to seasonal events such as Black Friday and Christmas. Poorly-constructed fakes such as baby teethers have even been found to be available on popular marketplaces, putting young children at risk of choking.</p>



<p>A Senate Finance Committee staff report published on November 7 calls for U.S Customs and Border Protection to be able to share more information on counterfeits with private sector firms such as ecommerce platforms, but search engines themselves have a greater role to play in fighting online counterfeiting.</p>



<h3>The dangers of fake children’s products</h3>



<p>Toy brands abide by stringent regulation on materials and methods of manufacturing – and adhere to stricter regulation still for baby products. All items sold must also include detailed warnings and instructions to ensure their proper use.</p>



<p>Counterfeiters, on the other hand, care little about child safety and produce toys in unsanitary and unregulated environments, using poor-quality or even toxic parts.</p>



<p>Last December, it was reported that a 4-year-old child in the US was rushed to hospital after swallowing 13 tiny magnets exposed when a counterfeit toy broke apart <sup>[1]</sup>. The internal infection that spread as a result meant the child had to have parts of their colon and intestines removed, leaving them permanently scarred.</p>



<p>News publications initially identified the toy as ‘Magformers’, a magnetic construction set sold by a US firm. According to Inc.com, it was only after further investigation that it was revealed the product was a counterfeit produced by a Chinese company and, disturbingly, was widely available on marketplaces.</p>



<h3>Notorious online marketplaces found in search results</h3>



<p>Fake children’s products such as baby teethers are appearing at the top of search results and are readily available to consumers.</p>



<p>Incopro&#8217;s research reveals that searches for teethers contain a number of online marketplace listings – many of which offer fake or unsafe products. Of the first 10 results that would be displayed to a consumer, 32.5% directed to online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and ‘DHGate’. Of these, 65.4% appeared within the first five results on the page.</p>



<p>The chart below shows research on the volume of traffic that is directed via search engines to some of the largest global marketplaces that are gripped by counterfeiting.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Percentage-of-marketplace-traffic-from-organic-search_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>More than 50% of the traffic going to the notorious marketplaces ‘Prom’ (based in Ukraine), ‘Made-in-China’ and ‘DHGate’ (both based in China) is through organic search.</p></blockquote>



<p>Consumers finding and purchasing low-priced fakes on marketplaces outside of their home country is alarming. Many of these results are displayed when consumers search for branded toys and are designed to deceive them into thinking they are genuine.</p>



<h3>Searches for wholesale Comotomo teethers contain counterfeits</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Wholesale-Comotomo-teether_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>A keyword search on Google.com for “wholesale comotomo teether” presented nine organic search results, each of which directed to a marketplace or ecommerce site. Of the nine organic search results, three were for potentially harmful products that misused the Comotomo trademark (highlighted in red).<br><br><em>Screenshot: A keyword search on Google.com for “wholesale comotomo teether” (Incopro, 2019). Note: The first result is a paid advertisement</em></p>



<p>The second organic result is a link to a category page on Alibaba and not a specific product, making it more challenging to get the marketplace to take action.</p>



<p>The presence of the brand name confuses the consumer &#8211; the page lists products that are the same or similar to the Comotomo products but are sold at a fraction of the price and are potentially harmful.</p>



<p>The search result also uses metadata supplied by Alibaba as seen below. The impression given to the consumer is that they will be landing on a page with 150 Comotomo products &#8211; this is not the case.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba-category-metadata-Comotomo-Baby-Suppliers_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p><em>Screenshot: Metadata on Alibaba category page for ‘Comotomo Baby Suppliers’ (Incopro, 2019). </em></p>



<p>Below the Alibaba search result is an example of another type of wholesale supplier. ‘ywhgifts.com’ sells a wide variety of counterfeits, from teething toys to baby applicators and cell phone cases. This site continues to receive a huge share of traffic from organic search (76.89% over the past year) despite its status.</p>



<p>Brand names for these products are prominently displayed in these results, leading to confusion that these products are produced by Comotomo when several are not.</p>



<h2>Search engines must do more</h2>



<p>Brands can demand fake products be taken down from marketplaces, but this is of little practical use &#8211; it would not deal with the results pages hosted on these sites that are deceiving consumers.</p>



<p>Search engines, instead, need to get ahead of the game and provide a technology-based solution to tackle counterfeits. In doing so, they can demonstrate their willingness to proactively engage in wider anti-counterfeiting efforts alongside the government and ecommerce platforms and protect children from serious harm.</p>



<p>If they sit back and refuse, case law that extends liability to search engines for harmful counterfeits may come calling.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>According to new Incopro research, up to 60% of the first-page results for the search query ‘buy Bactrim online’ (a branded antibiotic) are for sites selling counterfeit or unsafe products.</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pharma_6-in-10-search-results-unlawful_-positive_RGB_V2-1024x394.png" alt="" width="400" height="154" /></p>
<p>Fake pharmaceuticals are on the rise and are readily available online, with Search Engines pivotal in directing users to infringing locations. To uncover the scale of the issue, Incopro has undertaken new research into the role Search Engines play in serving counterfeit and other illegal content to unwitting consumers.</p>
<p>Search Engines are enabling illegal online pharmacies to flourish, and this puts consumers at great risk. Search engines should provide a scalable solution to help brands remove illegal online pharmacies from their index.</p>
<h2>The dangers of fake pharmaceuticals</h2>
<p>Consumers exposed to fake medications are put at severe risk. Counterfeits leave health issues untreated and may, in fact, make them worse by building pathogen resistance against an active ingredient found in the genuine drug. Consumers given the wrong dosages can also be susceptible to adverse side effects. In some cases, counterfeiters even add dangerous or toxic substances to their products to achieve a ‘desired’ side-effect to give them the aura of authenticity.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/One-third-of-medicines-are-fake_RGB.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>According to pharmaceutical company Bayer other examples of counterfeited drugs include[1]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products with manipulated expiration dates</li>
<li>Products containing no active agents (rendering the medicine useless)</li>
<li>­­Products wrapped in forged packaging</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding counterfeits through search</h3>
<p>Search Engines play a direct role in enabling illicit trade, with consumers fooled by the faux legitimacy given to locations found at the top of search queries. Alarmingly, consumers most often reach counterfeit locations through organic search queries, rather than direct links.</p>
<p>Incopro research reveals that, on average, over 58% of traffic for infringing pharmaceutical websites originates from organic search. Over 47% of traffic to these infringing locations comes from keywords that specify a brand or a particular product. This echoes a study by IFOP, a leading international polling and market research firm, that highlights that 47% of people who had bought an infringing product typed the name of the product into a Search Engine before making a purchase.</p>
<p>For pharmaceuticals, our research found that total traffic from product or brand keywords is 60%, indicating that consumers look for specific drugs when using search and are likely being unknowingly misdirected to infringing sites.</p>
<h4>Counterfeits appearing at the top of search results</h4>
<p>The problem is exacerbated by fraudulent websites appearing at the top of search results for popular queries. According to a 2017 study by one of the world’s largest telecommunications groups, Optify, the first result shown on a search query will receive over 44% of all “click-throughs”[2].</p>
<p>After an update to Google’s search algorithm in August 2018, dubbed ‘Medic’[3], commentators began suggesting that the platform may be inadvertently favoring fraudulent websites[4]. The update, while reportedly not aimed at the medical and health space, had the greatest impact on sites within this sector and, as with all previous core algorithm changes, was designed to “benefit pages that were previously under-rewarded”.</p>
<p>For the five sectors investigated in this study, more than 26% of potentially harmful sites appeared within the first three search results.</p>
<h4>Brand names and trademarks used within domains</h4>
<p>Those results appearing in the top spots were more likely to have a brand name in the domain name itself, indicating that search algorithms may, in fact, be favoring illicit locations that hijack trademarks for SEO.</p>
<p>Applying Incopro’s visibility score, our data-science-led method of indicating how visible an infringement is to consumers, we discovered that over 27% of potentially harmful websites had a visibility score of 10 or above, meaning that there was a high chance of being found by users. The analysis found that brand names and product-specific keywords were, again, prevalent in the domain names of these websites.</p>
<p>The screenshot below is the search results on Google.com for the term ‘buy Bactrim online’. Potentially harmful sites are highlighted in red, lawful sites in yellow, and “information only” websites in blue.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Screenshot taken on 07/05/2019: Search results on Google.com for the term ‘buy Bactrim online’ (Incopro, 2019)</em></p>
<p>60% of the results above were identified as potentially harmful. A “potentially harmful site” will typically use a third-party registered trademark without permission and fraudulently claim to be accredited by regulatory bodies[5].</p>
<p>By combining the highly conservative conversion rate of 2.5%[6] and the average traffic coming from organic search, we estimate that an infringing pharmaceutical site will sell to 642 users a month.</p>
<p>With this issue now reaching a critical state; we believe Search Engines can do more to stop it.</p>
<h3>An opportunity to protect consumers</h3>
<p>Google’s dominance is clear, holding 92.42% of the global market share today. But it is important to note that Search Engines such as Baidu, in China, and Yandex, in Russia, have a stronghold of their domestic markets (66.89% and 49.13% respectively).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Search-Engine-market-share-1024x350.png" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Search Engine market share (Incopro, 2019)</em></p>
<p>The FDA and other government bodies have limited resources and cannot solve the issue alone. Brand owners should be able to seek remedies for themselves and alert platforms to infringement.</p>
<p>However, the issue needs to be approached at a sector level if it is to be effectively solved; online infringers are adept at switching tactics when one source of traffic and revenue is shut off.</p>
<p>By taking the lead, Search Engines can together set the standard for protecting consumers online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Search engines are indexing websites containing dangerous counterfeit automotive parts, putting consumers at risk.</h2>
<p>The automotive sector faces huge volumes of counterfeit vehicle parts; the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) estimates that more than €2 billion is lost each year due to counterfeit tires and batteries being sold and offered for sale inside the EU.</p>
<p>Particularly alarming is the recurrence of counterfeit airbags within the top search results. New Incopro research reveals that one website selling counterfeit Honda airbags received 61.24% of its traffic from organic search and placed on the first page of results.</p>
<h3>The risks posed by fake automotive parts</h3>
<p>Fake automotive parts do not adhere to stringent safety regulations and put consumers at great risk. Counterfeit airbags, brake pads, seatbelts and tires all increase the risk of serious injury or death if the vehicle outfitted with them is involved in an accident.</p>
<p>Counterfeit airbags have been linked to fatal car accidents. In 2017, a female driver crashed a Kia vehicle into a tree in Highland Park, Dallas, and tragically lost their life after their airbag failed to deploy. It was only two years later that investigators discovered that the airbag module was counterfeit – it was poorly constructed, did not contain a firing mechanism and the main inflatable airbag that should have been present was, instead, replaced by rags[2].</p>
<p>Fake brake pads have also been found to be made of all manner of unsuitable materials, including dried grass dyed to look like rubber.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Automotive_Counterfeit-brake-pad-stopping-distance_RGB-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A test conducted by Mercedes-Benz that compared real and fake brake pads showed that cars driving at 100km/h on a dry surface traveled a further 25 metres to come to a complete halt[3], potentially changing a minor accident into a major collision where human life is put at risk. BMW conducted another test in 2017 where fake brake pads started to smoke and disintegrate almost immediately, indicating that they would completely fail to bring a vehicle to a halt.</p>
<h3>Identifying dangerous websites within search results</h3>
<p>Fakes may be easy to identify in person, but it can be harder to do so when purchasing online. Consumers are lulled into a false sense of security when seeing automotive parts displayed on the first page of Google or other large search engines, reducing the level of scrutiny these products receive.</p>
<p>Incopro performed keyword searches for airbags, with and without the names of popular car brand names. The screenshot shown below shows the first 10 results of a keyword search on Yandex, the Russian search engine, using the term “купить airbag дешево” (English translation: “buy airbag cheap”).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Search-results-for-airbags-862x1024.png" alt="" width="550" height="653"><br />
<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The website in the seventh position (highlighted in red) has been identified as a harmful website. This website generates 61.24% of its traffic from organic search.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Automotive_Counterfeit-airbags-61-percent-organic-search_Teal.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A product page (showing a Honda branded airbag) of the airbag-master.ru website is shown in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Airbag-master.ru-selling-airbags.png" alt="" width="460" height="515"></p>
<p>In the example above, the website is advertising a Honda passenger airbag for 7,000 Russian Rubles, equivalent to approximately £89. The retail price of official Honda airbags is closer to £800. The site also offers a discount of 10% for those customers who buy 2 or more. Furthermore, the product is described in Russian as “Характеристики: неоригинал” which translates to indicate it is not an original manufactured product, despite their claims that they are working directly with the manufacturers. Add to that, the site claims to sell high-quality products, but on closer inspection, the airbag in the photo is, in fact, ripped. From all these indicators, Incopro is able to identify this search result as a harmful website.</p>
<p>A recent investigation undertaken by Incopro on behalf of a leading car manufacturer revealed that a website offering over 64,871 ‘branded’ parts, the majority priced below 50% RRP, was easily accessible through search engines. The low price and the fact that the items were stated to be shipped without the original packaging indicates this site was likely selling fakes and was therefore harmful to consumers.</p>
<h3>Counterfeits infiltrating the supply chain</h3>
<p>In recent Incopro research that asked US and UK consumers to indicate the fake products that pose the biggest threat to society, alarmingly, only 6% of US and UK consumers said fake car parts. This is despite the danger to life from fakes such as tires and brake pads. This figure likely reflects the fact that consumers are rarely part of the purchasing process for car parts; mechanics and authorized garages determine the replacement parts needed and will place the order.</p>
<p>It is likely that consumers will take their vehicle to a mechanic to source and fit an airbag. In the ever-competitive motor trade, garages are known to source cheap parts from various suppliers, including online sites such as the example highlighted above, ‘Airbag-Master.ru’.</p>
<p>Whilst the mechanic sourcing the airbag will have greater knowledge than the average user, there is still a risk that they may buy sub-standard or counterfeit parts, especially from wholesale sites offering parts at a discount. If counterfeits are bought in large quantities from these sites, there are widespread implications for drivers.</p>
<h3>What must search engines do to rectify the issue?</h3>
<p>It is brand owners and their representatives who are best placed to verify the authenticity of their branded car parts. However, there are currently no scalable solutions available to them to notify search engines and have infringing pages removed from results.</p>
<p>By providing a scalable solution for the removal of illicit results, search engines would have a lasting impact on this problem, especially where sites rely on organic traffic to survive. Incopro would welcome the ability for rights holders and their representatives to be able to take action against indexed pages or websites which directly lead to trademark infringing content.</p>
<p>By taking the lead, search engines can together set the standard for protecting consumers online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>When Google is told that it is indexing and returning search results for a webpage or website that is selling counterfeit products, it will take no action.</h2>
<p>Google’s refusal to act is putting consumers at risk; as an example, products such as counterfeit brake pads, fake antibiotics, and imitation baby teethers can all lead to potentially deadly consequences when used. Significant harm is also dealt to the companies targeted, who invest time and significant financial resource to create and market their brands.</p>
<p>Currently, Google will not de-index a specific page or website that offers counterfeits.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter" style="font-size: 14px;" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Google-logo_RGB_V2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Lack of action putting consumers at risk across the globe</h3>
<p>Recent research on search engine responsibility reveals that up to 60% of results returned offer consumers access to counterfeit and possibly dangerous goods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pharma_6-in-10-search-results-unlawful_-positive_RGB_V2-1024x394.png" alt="" width="450" height="173"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">In pharmaceuticals, six in 10 of Google’s first-page results following searches for the antibiotic Bactrim were for sites very likely to be operating unlawfully;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">In the children’s products category, a third of search results for a “Comotomo teether” featured potentially harmful products that misuse the Comotomo trademark;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">In the white goods sector, a search for refrigerator filters repeatedly directed consumers towards a website selling counterfeit goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>These sites, often dedicated to selling knock off products, don’t just infringe IP but are also potentially deadly &#8211; fake pharmaceuticals, car airbags, and fake cycle helmets are all widely available and put consumers at extreme risk.</p>
<p>The scale of this issue is enormous.</p>
<p>In this newly released White Paper, the findings demonstrate that in one month alone and for a single sample product in certain categories of consumer products, there were over 1,000 websites indexed by Google that sell infringing products to consumers.</p>
<p>If Google did remove these websites from their index these sites would be starved of oxygen and would fail, and there are case studies that prove so.&nbsp; The people who operate infringing websites don’t typically pay for advertising. Instead, they often rely on organic search, knowing that they will be found when consumers use search engines to look for brands or products.</p>
<h3>Google’s at odds with its own practices</h3>
<p>Google’s refusal is out of step with its own practices when dealing with other types of intellectual property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google will remove a URL from its search index when it is told that the page infringes copyright. Google removes millions of URLs on this basis.</li>
<li>However, Google won’t act when it is told that a URL is selling counterfeits – where trademark rights are infringed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This inconsistent approach stems from a difference in treatment for copyright and trademarks in the US.</p>
<p>Google acts against copyright infringement because it is legally required to do so under US law; the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requires Google to remove copyright infringing pages from its index when notified.</p>
<p>There is no similar legislation in the US that requires tech platforms to act on trademark infringement and so Google does nothing.</p>
<p>Other tech platforms, however, do act when they are told about the sale of counterfeit products on their platforms because they fear that they will be held to be “publishers” if they do nothing.</p>
<p>Google takes the view that it cannot be a “publisher” and only takes the minimum action required to remain legally compliant.</p>
<h3>Other platform responses highlight a stark contrast</h3>
<p>Incopro’s technology searches across the internet for intellectual property infringement. Working on behalf of over 600 brands, we detect millions of instances of infringement taking place online every day.</p>
<p>When Incopro notifies big tech companies such as Facebook or eBay of counterfeits being sold through these sites, they will act by removing the offer for sale from their platform.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, however, when Incopro asks Google to take these infringements out of their index, the tech giant routinely turns down these requests.</p>
<p>The resulting enforcement gap creates enormous difficulty for brand owners looking to protect their rights and presents a real risk to their revenues. This gap is particularly apparent when websites or even entire networks dedicated to counterfeiting are identified.</p>
<h3>Google can and should be challenged</h3>
<p>From a moral and cultural perspective, there is a compelling case that Google should do more when it knows that it’s displaying search results for counterfeits – products such as <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/blog/the-escalating-pharmaceutical-counterfeit-problem">fake anti-malarials</a> will put consumer&#8217;s health at serious risk, for example.</p>
<p>But there is also a growing legal case.</p>
<p>First, there is now a clear and developed line of legal authority that empowers the courts to require Google to act. The legal cases on this have been developed in several key jurisdictions and they are examined in detail by the law firms who have contributed opinions for this White Paper.</p>
<p>Google should cooperate with trademark owners and develop a streamlined and scaled approach to support court orders that enable Google to act with the protection of the courts. Instead, Google takes a combative stance, insisting on fighting any attempt to require it to do anything in this area.</p>
<p>Second, if Google continues to refuse to cooperate then it may be found to be liable for refusing to act when it is told about infringements that it indexes.</p>
<h3>What can brands do?</h3>
<p>So what are brands to do? Google’s position is that brands must obtain a court order against the sites themselves. Only then will they act. The reason being that the site must be declared illegal before they will move.</p>
<p>But if the same infringing site is featured in a Facebook or Instagram promotion, these platforms will respond and remove without requiring a court order. If it’s clear to other large tech platforms that there is clear infringement of trademark taking place, why is the same evidence regarded by Google as inadequate?</p>
<p>Google and other search engines are at the center of this. They should provide a scalable means to tackle this vast problem, or case law may come calling.</p>
<h2>It’s time for Google to change its approach</h2>
<p>Incopro is calling for search engines to work more closely with rights owners and their representatives to remove counterfeiters from the results they present to consumers.</p>
<p>This White Paper aims to provoke discussion amongst lawmakers, brands, platforms and other interested parties about how to establish a framework under which search engines take on a greater role in tackling consumer harm online.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>New thinking is required if the online counterfeiting threat to businesses and consumers is to be tackled effectively and at scale.</h2>
<p>Intellectual property infringement online is an epidemic and is putting consumers at risk. Sitting at the heart of the issue is the sale of a counterfeit goods through websites, online marketplaces and social media.</p>
<p>Incopro has undertaken new research into the role search engines play in directing unwitting consumers to locations selling fakes. The research focuses on counterfeit pharmaceuticals, children’s products, automotive parts and safety equipment.</p>
<h2>A global anti-counterfeiting response required</h2>
<p>A recent OECD report[1], published in March 2019, warns that the value of trade in counterfeit goods is US$509 billion, or 3.3% of all world trade. The report notes sub-standard products such as fake car parts, cosmetics and electrical goods put consumer safety at serious risk. The 2018 Electrical Safety First report[2] found that 30% of UK consumers have been duped by fake electrical goods. For pharmaceuticals, the World Health Organisation reports that an estimated 1 in 10 medical products in low- and middle-income countries is substandard or falsified[3].</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.3-world-trade-counterfeit-1.png" alt="" /><br />Counterfeiters are not regulated, do not comply with safety standards and have no incentive to ensure consumer safety. They do not invest in research and development, do not pay taxes and often exploit workers to make products at low cost in poor conditions. Counterfeiting is also known to fund organised criminal activity and terrorism.<a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2"></a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>
<h3>The role of internet intermediaries</h3>
<p>All internet intermediaries are able to play a role in upholding the law and preventing harm. They are the operators that build substantial and profitable businesses by providing the online infrastructure: hosting websites, supplying domain names, enabling Internet access, distributing online material, supporting Internet advertising and facilitating online payments etc.</p>
<p>Search engines are a core internet intermediary. They are the focus of our upcoming White Paper. They are extremely powerful tools with the technological power to index everything that is online, anywhere in the world.</p>
<h3>Threats to consumer safety</h3>
<p>The world’s information includes internet locations that sell products that cause very significant harm.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/60-search-results-are-counterfeit.png" alt="" /><br />When consumers use the internet to search for locations offering consumer products such as pharmaceuticals, baby teethers and safety helmets, up to 60% of the search results returned can be for locations selling counterfeit products. Counterfeiters use search to get to the customers that they want.</p>
<p>The problem is massive – a big problem that requires a big solution.</p>
<h3>Where does the law stand?</h3>
<p>Hosting intermediaries like Facebook, Amazon and eBay are protected from any liability for damages where they operate as the passive host &#8211; but they lose this “privilege” when they are notified of a particular infringement on their platform.</p>
<p>Search engines, on the other hand, are not host intermediaries. They take the view that they do not need to take any action when they are told about a counterfeit site indexed in their search results.</p>
<p>However, that difference in legal treatment is changing. Case law is developing that may ultimately present a liability challenge to search engines once they are put on notice.</p>
<p>In a series of precedent setting cases in Canada, the United Kingdom and France, it has been established that courts can require search engines to de-index a website.</p>
<h3>An opportunity to set the standard for intermediaries</h3>
<p>Search engines need to get ahead of the game. In doing so, they can demonstrate their willingness to proactively engage in anti-counterfeiting solutions.</p>
<p>Our ask is simple: by pivoting on their current position to work with rights holders and companies like Incopro, search engines can act in the interests of the online consumer.</p>
<p>If they sit back and refuse, case law that is more dramatic may come calling.</p>
