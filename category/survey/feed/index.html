<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>As the world starts to look beyond the pandemic, Brand Protection teams are placing collaboration between functions such as Legal, Marketing &amp; Ecommerce at the center of strategies for 2021.</strong></p>



<p>In a recent&nbsp;two-part&nbsp;survey, we&nbsp;asked the INSYNC Community about the&nbsp;challenges they faced&nbsp;in 2020&nbsp;and&nbsp;changes to the way they operated.</p>



<p>In the second&nbsp;part of the survey,&nbsp;we&nbsp;posed questions on&nbsp;how&nbsp;teams&nbsp;will approach Brand Protection in 2021.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;survey data shows that many brands&nbsp;are moving beyond just anti-counterfeiting to build strategies&nbsp;to&nbsp;protect every digital consumer touchpoint –&nbsp;and&nbsp;reacting to the rise of new platforms and the growth in social commerce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from internal considerations, platforms will be a key focus for the Community in 2021. In a year where the tech giants will be under increased regulatory focus in multiple geographies&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the&nbsp;massive&nbsp;growth of their&nbsp;influence&nbsp;over society, there is a real opportunity to drive change in the way that platforms work with brands to protect consumers – and collaboration will be key to taking advantage of these trends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">1. 2021 Brand Protection Goals&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With&nbsp;shifting&nbsp;priorities&nbsp;and a fast-moving&nbsp;online environment, we asked the INSYNC Community for&nbsp;their teams’ Brand Protection goals&nbsp;in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>&nbsp;Protecting intellectual property understandably remains as a core goal &#8211; however, protecting consumer trust (a value held close by marketing teams) was also cited by almost a third of respondents.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="480" height="288" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12790" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png 480w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption><em>Figure&nbsp;1: Top 5 Strategic Goals for 2021</em>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<ol start="2"><li>Protecting consumer trust &amp; safety are viewed as two critical priorities that drive long term business performance&nbsp;– with nearly half of respondents citing one of these as a key goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li>This increased strategic focus on the consumer is helping drive engagement beyond the legal function.&nbsp;With trust &amp; authenticity&nbsp;being a&nbsp;key focuses&nbsp;for marketers, positioning the impact of brand protection in these terms appears an effective method to drive cross-functional engagement – and could be the key to unlocking shared budgets -with consumers holding brands responsible&nbsp;for protecting them from threats.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/the-5th-p-of-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recent&nbsp;Incopro research</a>&nbsp;found that&nbsp;consumers overwhelmingly believe that brands&nbsp;are responsible for protecting them online:&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">2.&nbsp;Strategic priorities for 2021&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="444" height="242" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12786" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png 444w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-300x164.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /><figcaption><em>Figure&nbsp;2:&nbsp;Strategic Priorities for 2021</em> &#8211; INSYNC Community Survey&nbsp;<em>(Jan,&nbsp;2021)</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-1-increasing-collaboration-internally">1. Increasing collaboration internally</h3>



<p>Despite, or perhaps&nbsp;<em>because of,</em>&nbsp;the changing threat landscape, the number one strategic priority for 2021 is increasing collaboration internally – with&nbsp;<strong>64%</strong>&nbsp;citing this as a priority.&nbsp;Brands who have succeeded in building cross-functional collaboration&nbsp;typically see increased awareness of the role protecting brand can play in business success – ensuring alignment with business goals and in many cases&nbsp;easing budget constraints.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-monitoring-new-platforms-or-digital-channels"><strong>2. Monitoring new platforms or digital channels</strong></h3>



<p>In 2020, the platform landscape continued to evolve, with rapid user growth driving increased focus on platforms like&nbsp;Pinduoduo&nbsp;or&nbsp;Tiktok, and the&nbsp;rise of social commerce meaning brands need to be ready to adapt&nbsp;their strategies rapidly. However, in a world with constrained budgets, brands will need to continue to&nbsp;prioritise&nbsp;the key channels&nbsp;that matter to their business and&nbsp;consumers.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-addressing-new-online-threats">3. Addressing new online threats</h3>



<p>The accelerated shift online in 2020 has driven many brands to re-appraise their focus – moving&nbsp;beyond IP infringement and counterfeiting to address broader threats to the&nbsp;online&nbsp;consumer relationship,&nbsp;from negative association to price gouging.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-shifting-focus-from-offline-to-online-protection">4. Shifting focus from offline to online protection</h3>



<p id="h-as-brands-respond-to-the-increased-importance-of-their-digital-consumer-relationships-and-growing-threats-often-in-the-context-of-constrained-resources-shifting-focus-from-offline-to-online-was-cited-as-a-priority-by-36-of-respondents-whilst-for-some-this-means-shifting-budgets-for-others-the-focus-will-be-better-leveraging-online-intelligence-to-drive-the-efficiency-of-their-offline-operations">As brands respond to the&nbsp;increased importance of their digital consumer relationships and&nbsp;growing threats – often in the context of constrained resources&nbsp;–&nbsp;shifting focus from offline to online was cited as a priority by&nbsp;36% of respondents. Whilst for some this means shifting budgets, for others the focus will be better leveraging online intelligence to drive the efficiency of their offline operations.</p>



<p><strong>While the threat landscape facing each brand will be different, the&nbsp;transformation driven by&nbsp;COVID should drive all teams to review their strategies to ensure the most effective use of their resources to protect their brand and consumers.</strong></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">3.&nbsp;Platforms:&nbsp;a key focus for 2021</h2>



<p>Following high-profile action taken&nbsp;by platforms&nbsp;against&nbsp;then-President Trump, tech giants&nbsp;are&nbsp;once again under&nbsp;the microscope for&nbsp;the role they play in&nbsp;facilitating&nbsp;prohibited and harmful content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Law makers are&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;moving&nbsp;towards&nbsp;increased&nbsp;regulation&nbsp;for social media platforms, deeming them to be publishers&nbsp;rather than mere platforms that host third-party content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any changes to the regulatory landscape&nbsp;are&nbsp;likely to have far reaching consequences for the Brand Protection community&nbsp;– potentially making it easier for brands to have infringing content&nbsp;removed.&nbsp;</p>



<ul start="4"><li>1. Survey respondents&nbsp;cited a range of challenges that will be familiar to brand protection experts – from managing constrained budgets and the need to prioritize, to improved engagement with enforcement agencies or adopting the right enforcement strategy to deliver impact and avoid playing whack a mole.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul start="5"><li>2. However, the most common theme was around the&nbsp;policies and working practices of platforms, where many respondents&nbsp;cited continued challenges&nbsp;in protecting their consumers.&nbsp;Though 2020 saw improvements in some areas – for instance proactive enforcement of&nbsp;COVID-related issues &#8211;&nbsp;the&nbsp;policies and responsiveness of platforms remains a critical&nbsp;step in the journey to protecting consumers online.&nbsp;Improvements across five key areas were highlighted on the 2021 wish lists from the INSYNC community:<br><br>a. Improved responsiveness to takedown notices<br><br>b. Increased penalties for repeat offenders<br><br>c. Improved working relationships with platforms in APAC<br><br>d. Improved data sharing of bad actor intelligence<br><br>e. Proactive&nbsp;monitoring &amp;&nbsp;protection&nbsp;from platforms&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul start="6"><li>3. 2021 will see&nbsp;significant regulatory focus on platforms across multiple geographies&nbsp;– from anti-trust cases&nbsp;in the US and EU&nbsp;to broad-focused reviews of the online space such as the Digital Services Act in the EU or the UK’s Online Harms review. Whilst&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;initiatives such as the Shop Safe Act in the US focus&nbsp;purely on Brand Protection issues, it is critical that the community speaks with a united voice to ensure the changes brands need to protect their consumers online are heard loud and clear.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 class="heading-branded">We asked the&nbsp;INSYNC Community for their 2021&nbsp;Wishlists&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Here&nbsp;is&nbsp;a selection of quotes that our respondents provided, reinforcing the strategic priorities&nbsp;outlined&nbsp;above:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>“Leveraging our online intelligence to efficiently provide leads for offline&nbsp;action”&nbsp;</li><li>“Increased collaboration between Legal and Marketing to&nbsp;deliver a comprehensive&nbsp;program”&nbsp;</li><li>“Stronger action from marketplaces on repeat offenders”</li><li>“More proactivity from platforms&nbsp;and increased sharing of bad actor intelligence”</li><li>“More staff and&nbsp;more budget!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>“More buy in&nbsp;from the big platforms and entities that create the internet&nbsp;globally”&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">4.&nbsp;Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As for many others, 2020 was a year of significant challenge for the&nbsp;Brand&nbsp;Protection community, but&nbsp;the transformation&nbsp;that has occurred has created the opportunity for 2021 to be a year of meaningful change and growth.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-brand-protection-more-central-to-digital-strategy"><strong>Brand&nbsp;Protection more central to digital strategy</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>With an increased focus on the online space and brands’ digital presence, brand protection has become more central to brands’ digital strategies –&nbsp;driving much needed improvements in awareness and collaboration.&nbsp;Brand protection&nbsp;teams must remain proactive in engaging their businesses, and&nbsp;speak the language of the marketing, e-commerce and security to&nbsp;secure the collaboration and budget needed to&nbsp;succeed.&nbsp;As we hope to emerge&nbsp;from the impact of the pandemic, teams will need to review and refocus strategies to ensure they are meeting the needs of their brand and consumers in the transformed online world.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-cross-brand-collaboration-is-critical">Cross-brand collaboration&nbsp;is&nbsp;critical&nbsp;</h3>



<p>While brand protection teams can and must&nbsp;reorganize&nbsp;internally and revise strategies to respond to the rapidly changing environment, platforms will remain a key part of the puzzle&nbsp;not obviously within their control. But in an environment&nbsp;where existing approaches are under the microscope from regulators, there is an opportunity&nbsp;to drive change through cross-brand collaboration&nbsp;–&nbsp;both in working with regulators and the platforms themselves. Whilst a single brand can struggle to effect change on their own, the strength of brands together&nbsp;has the potential to make a real difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>We look forward to working with the INSYNC community&nbsp;to achieve these aims in 2021&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;helping to&nbsp;make the internet better for businesses and the consumers.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Brand Protection teams faced an unrivalled challenge in 2020 – trying to protect consumers from an explosion in online threats at a time when offices were closed, offline enforcement channels were heavily disrupted and many of their businesses came under severe financial pressure.</strong></p>



<p>However, the INSYNC Community has been swift to adapt in the face of the changing landscape – with our survey showing teams responding to the acceleration in the shift online by revising strategies, increasing collaboration, and successfully placing protecting their brand online at the heart of business strategy.</p>



<p>Despite the obvious challenges, these trends offer a foundation for teams to push on in 2021. Businesses have the means to succeed in protecting their brands &amp; consumers online and to seize on the opportunity offered by increased e-commerce activity:</p>



<ul><li><strong>42%</strong> growth in e-commerce [1]</li><li><strong>227%</strong> increase in internet usage (UK) [2]</li><li><strong>82%</strong> of respondents saw increased online threats</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">2020: Three key trends&nbsp;</h2>



<p>2020 created a unique set of challenges for&nbsp;Brand&nbsp;Protection teams, with consumers exposed to increased online risks at a time&nbsp;when working remotely and often with reduced teams. Nonetheless, these pressures appear to have raised awareness of the importance of&nbsp;protecting brands online, increased collaboration internally, and in a surprising number of cases led to increased budgets –&nbsp;and these trends can provide insight for the whole Community on strategy in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-1-increased-threats-online">1)&nbsp;Increased&nbsp;threats online&nbsp;</h3>



<ol><li><strong>82%</strong>&nbsp;of respondents&nbsp;saw increase in both volume and&nbsp;type&nbsp;of&nbsp;online&nbsp;threats&nbsp;they were facing.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li>As ever, bad actors responded rapidly to changing consumer&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;and demand,&nbsp;capitalizing&nbsp;on increased time&nbsp;spent online with an explosion of phishing scams and&nbsp;counterfeit products appearing in categories never previously attacked.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h3 id="h-2-protecting-brand-online-viewed-increasingly-as-strategic-priority">2)&nbsp;Protecting brand online viewed increasingly as strategic&nbsp;priority&nbsp;</h3>



<ol><li><strong>78%</strong>&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;that&nbsp;online&nbsp;Brand&nbsp;Protection had become more important strategically&nbsp;–&nbsp;and of these, over&nbsp;<strong>80%</strong>&nbsp;of respondents said they had increased collaboration with different functions.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li>For many sectors directly impacted by the pandemic – pharmaceuticals or household cleaning products, for instance – addressing the increased threat online became a C-suite issue and drove&nbsp;close collaboration between legal and&nbsp;marketing&nbsp;teams.&nbsp;But with the increased online sales, even brands in hard-hit-sectors such as fashion saw the importance&nbsp;of protecting sales online when&nbsp;online became the only channel.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h3 id="h-3-budget-changes-a-mixed-picture"><strong>3)&nbsp;Budget changes&nbsp;–&nbsp;a mixed picture</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<ol><li>While budgets have come under pressure across all businesses,&nbsp;<strong>36</strong><strong>%</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;respondents&nbsp;had seen&nbsp;some level of increase to budgets, while&nbsp;<strong>27%</strong>&nbsp;had seen budgets increase significantly.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li>However, this left over a third of brands facing increased threat levels with&nbsp;flat or reduced budgets – increasing the pressure on already under-resourced&nbsp;brand protection teams.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li>Budgets have clearly been impacted by overall business performance, with more discretionary sectors most negatively impacted. However,&nbsp;a key theme for those who have succeeded in increasing investment is a cross-functional approach that has raised awareness internally of the importance of protecting brand, both offline&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;online.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h2 class="heading-branded">We asked the INSYNC Community: “What changed in 2020?”</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Bad actors immediately exploited the situation created by offline restrictions</strong> <br><br>“As the lockdowns happened globally, one after the other, we saw a surge in online issues few weeks after countries closed their offline business. It was quite immediate.&#8221;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Businesses faced a substantial increase iZn threats to their consumers online</strong><br><br>“The pandemic resulted in a substantial increase in fraudulent websites, trademark abuse and counterfeiting.”</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Online enforcement emerged as the main tool to mitigate threats</strong><br><br>“Limited offline enforcement during the pandemic restricted our ability to mitigate threats to our brand.”</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Protecting digital marketing touchpoints critical as new consumer demographics move online</strong><br><br>“Online marketing became increasingly important, so we’ve shifted our strategy to protect these investments.”</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Businesses in precarious position if budgets are not aligned to increased threats</strong><br><br>“Reduced sales have led to pressure on budgets despite increased threats.”</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Online is now the core channel and must be prioritized</strong> <br><br>“The closure of offline shopping channels has made protecting our online sales even more important.”</li></ul>



<p>Looking back at the existential threats posed by bad actors throughout 2020 and the precarious position forced by stretched budgets, it is clear that Brand Protection teams within the Community went above and beyond. They worked closely together, were quick to reprioritize workload, and were able to pivot strategy rapidly &#8211; ensuring that consumers were protected and digital channels were safeguarded.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/brand-protection-survey-outlook-for-2021/">In part 2 of our Brand Protection survey series</a>, we explore the outlook for 2021 and highlight why Brand Protection teams are identifying internal collaboration as a core component to their strategies. We also set out why greater scrutiny of platform behavior and a renewed drive to working with them directly to protect consumers is likely to be a critical focus going forward.</p>
