										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Incopro’s Online Brand Protection experts deliver tangible outcomes to brands by reducing infringement and increasing sales. However, they are also able to offer bespoke analysis and expertise in niche areas such as regulatory compliance and site-blocking.</h2>
<p>Incopro’s Investigations team handles unique cases that brands are looking to investigate outside of their main focus areas. These cases range from intelligence gathering and offline investigation work, trend analysis and bespoke reporting, to test purchases, regulatory compliance monitoring and sophisticated anti-piracy action.</p>
<p>Incopro’s Special Projects team is headed by Joshua Hopping. A seasoned veteran of the intellectual property and brand protection space with over 16 years of experience, Joshua works with <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/news/incopro-analyst-joshua-hopping-elected-infragard-board-of-directors">FBI-affiliated &#8216;InfraGard&#8217;</a>, having been elected to the non-profit partnership in 2018. As part of this role, he shares valuable knowledge and intelligence on anti-counterfeiting strategy and helps inform large-scale operations.</p>
<p>Below, we explore a number of short Special Projects case studies and discuss the outcomes they have delivered for Incopro customers beyond the scope of standard enforcement activity offered by our dedicated Online Brand Protection teams.</p>
<h3>Expertise in compliance monitoring and reporting</h3>
<p>Incopro’s Special Projects team often works in areas outside of intellectual property infringement. They examine issues relating to regulatory compliance, terms and conditions violations, and parallel imports – all areas that traditionally sit outside of the remit of brands’ Brand Protection teams and IP counsels.</p>
<p>One of our current Special Projects clients enlists the support of Incopro to help them collect bespoke data on parallel import goods and issues relating to illicit trade – an area that their current brand protection provider is unable to deliver in. The team works to identify and report on products authorized for sale outside the EU being imported into the EU.</p>
<p>The identification of key seller profiles in Eastern Europe and East Asia and the documentation of their maintained stock levels is crucial to this project’s success. This data is then passed on to the brand for further action and is paramount to ensuring that goods with packaging that does not adhere to EU health and safety regulations do not reach consumers within the region.</p>
<h3>Bespoke intelligence reports</h3>
<p>An intelligence-led approach is needed to take down counterfeiters and other online infringers that operate within large illicit networks. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/network-intelligence/">Incopro’s Network Analysis technology</a> is used by our core analyst teams, but also by Special Projects to identify these networks and inform bespoke intelligence reports commissioned by brands.</p>
<p>Network Analysis automatically connects infringements across platforms, uncovering sophisticated counterfeit networks threatening a brand and enabling rapid enforcement at scale. It combines market-leading automated image and keyword matching technology to identify infringement and link related sellers and listings.</p>
<p>The Special Projects team utilizes Network Analysis to identify large targets for one of our customers in the gaming sector. Their primary goal is to find networks that are distributing unauthorized digital goods (UDGs). UDGs include illegitimately obtained keys (a code to activate a digital copy of a game), digital currency, and player accounts. These digital goods contravene game publishers’ T&amp;Cs and are sold at low prices, undercutting sales of authorized digital goods in the process. They cause further headaches for the publisher&#8217;s moderation team whom are tasked with finding and removing the countless player accounts linked to this unauthorized activity, including both buyers and end-users of these accounts.</p>
<p>Large-scale global counterfeit targets have also been identified for one of the world’s largest sportswear brands to facilitate online and offline enforcement activity to disrupt their operations. For a large multinational cosmetics company, the team was tasked with identifying key sellers, problematic marketplaces and regional hotbeds for counterfeiting activity, and providing trend analysis for the May, June and July 2018.</p>
<h3>Specialism in test purchasing and offline action</h3>
<p>If it is unclear whether a listing is counterfeit from its imagery or description alone, it may be necessary that an analyst gathers evidence through a test purchase. Talisman has inbuilt test-purchase functionality, and we have a global network of offline investigation partners we work with to conduct this work, including in Japan, China, South Korea, USA, and the UK.</p>
<p>In a previous illicit trade case, the Special Projects team collaborated with one of these partners to conduct test purchases to verify the legitimacy of heat cigarette caps and identify whether they were of parallel import. This action ensured that products not certified for sale within the EU were removed from marketplaces.</p>
<p>As part of our investigation work, the Special Projects team works alongside our specialist partners to select targets for offline work such as raids of premises. In 2018, Incopro provided data on a phone repair service suspected of using counterfeit parts to WRi, who then liaised with the police, Trading Standards, and the border force to <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/case-studies/wri-case-study-brand-protection-strategy">conduct a raid against the premises</a>. The raid led to the confiscation of over 9,000 counterfeit and potentially unsafe electrical items and a complete shutdown of the illicit operation.<br /><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Electrical-goods-seized-by-Incopro-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3>Additional anti-piracy support</h3>
<p>Working alongside some of the world’s largest screening associations, Incopro delivers anti-piracy reporting and intelligence that has been used to inform site-blocking orders. After site-blocking orders in Australia, Incopro was able to ensure lower overall usage rates of pirate sites in the region.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Piracy-sites-usage-graphic.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Collaborating with UK-based <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/incopro-legal-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incopro Legal Network</a> Partner Wiggin, Incopro works for one of the world’s largest academic publishers to prevent the piracy of academic papers and studies on platforms such as LibGen and SciHub. The project’s end goal is to provide site-blocking targets in several regions to prevent the dissemination of pirated papers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>To deliver value beyond enforcement and takedowns, analysts must be experts in online brand protection and fully understand a brand’s pain points.</h2>
<p>A subject of great confusion for brand owners is the exact role played by online brand protection analysts and the added value they provide. When posed with these difficult questions, vendors provide a wide variety of unsatisfactory answers.</p>
<p>Incopro analysts approach online brand protection strategically and methodically. Listings, seller accounts and offline premises are connected using <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/product/talisman-online-brand-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talisman</a>, our online brand protection tool, and are then enforced at scale to ensure lasting impact. A significant tenet of an analyst’s role, however, is to also employ trend and threat analysis to identify problem areas before they can fully materialise, helping a brand save on costly enforcement further down the line.</p>
<h3>Beyond the takedown</h3>
<p>Online brand protection vendors’ analysts are often described as ‘enforcement specialists’. Incopro’s analysts, however, deliver value beyond enforcement and takedowns. Through regular communication with our clients, and monthly tailored reports rather than data-dumps, analysts share their insights on future online threats allowing <em>preventative</em> rather than <em>reactionary</em> action.</p>
<p>In this guide, we break down four key traits of an online brand protection expert, highlighting the demonstrable benefits and costs saved by approaching the issue of infringement with more than just enforcement in mind.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Provides legal expertise and recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Whilst brands usually keep track of their trademark and patent portfolio, they may be unaware of gaps exploited in international regions. Without preventative measures, brands may be infringed in plain sight with impunity.</p>
<p>Coming from a wide range of backgrounds, Incopro analysts are experienced in providing advice to brand owners on how to alleviate infringement through trend and threat analysis. Analysts may recommend rights holders register trademarks in new territories and class categories to prevent exploitation of gaps in their portfolio and push back by sellers.</p>
<p>Further to legal recommendations, Incopro analysts are equipped to advise on market opportunities. For one of our clients in the hardware and open-source software space, we were able to convert grey market resellers in China to official resellers, providing access to a wider customer base and distribution network.</p>
<p><strong>2. Harnesses essential relationships and partnerships</strong></p>
<p>Enforcement is a complex issue, and for brands that do not work closely with platforms and offline specialists, it is a frustrating, slow process.</p>
<p>Incopro analysts each have their own specialisms along with broad experience across different regions, platforms and types of infringement. Analysts may also have dedicated roles for specific products; the London team, for example, has a ‘Watches and Luxury Brand Specialist’ whom is able to identify sophisticated copycats that even brand owners may struggle to tell apart from the genuine article.</p>
<p>Harnessing our partnerships with offline investigation specialists, Incopro analysts ensure that large scale infringers are shut down. In 2018 WRi, an offline investigator that specialises in anti-counterfeiting and anti-piracy, collaborated with Incopro and local authorities to raid a physical premises of a UK-based importer and trader where <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/case-study/wri-case-study-brand-protection-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9,000 counterfeit and potentially dangerous items were seized</a>. An examination of the premises was also able to link a Hong-Kong based supplier to the operation, spurring further investigation.</p>
<p>Importantly, Incopro analysts foster strong relationships with online platforms to prevent the friction that is traditionally associated with enforcement. These relationships also aid in our pre-emptive approach to brand protection, with online Chinese marketplace Taobao recently reaching out to one of our clients in the technology sector to advise them on how to avoid losing hardware sales to counterfeits ahead of Singles’ Day.</p>
<p>Going further than platform collaboration and offline investigation, Incopro’s Brand Protection Team Leader Joshua Hopping was <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/news/incopro-analyst-joshua-hopping-elected-infragard-board-of-directors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elected to the FBI-affiliated non-profit InfraGard</a> in September 2018.  As part of this role he shares valuable knowledge and intelligence on anti-counterfeiting.</p>
<p><strong>3. Offers international expertise</strong></p>
<p>Lacking resources or expertise to target counterfeiting operations abroad is a concern shared by many rights holders as they are unable to target the threats most damaging to their brands.</p>
<p>Local support and international coverage are essential to a comprehensive brand protection strategy. Incopro analysts are based in the UK, US and China and currently boast a 90% compliance rate across all major international marketplaces and social media platforms, including Alibaba and Amazon. Where there is no physical presence in counterfeiting hotspots such as Latin America and Eastern-Europe, analysts are trained to familiarise themselves with local platforms and law.</p>
<p><strong>Svetlana Ilnitskaya, Brand Protection Team Leader:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through in-house expert advice, platform relationships, and language skills, Incopro analysts have over a 90% compliance rate across all major marketplaces and social media platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The breadth of spoken languages within the teams is invaluable for platform collaboration and for configuring Talisman for international markets; at any one time, there are between 15 and 20 languages spoken fluently amongst the analyst team.</p>
<p><strong>4. Targets large-scale infringers to ensure lasting impact</strong></p>
<p>Online brand protection programmes often focus on the low-hanging fruit and provide minimal reduction in infringement or impact on your revenues. This equates to removing the symptoms rather than the problem.</p>
<p>A brand protection expert directs efforts towards taking down the large-scale infringers that are most damaging to your brand’s reputation and revenues. KPIs are set on reducing infringement and clearing up target platforms, rather than the number of enforcement notices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Enforcement_stats_-_In-line_graphic-1024x480.png" alt="" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>By targeting the most visible and damaging threats on Amazon and eBay for one of our clients, Incopro relieved pressure on their online DVD prices. Before they enlisted Talisman, lower priced pirate copies were regularly placing first in both marketplaces’ search results, forcing our client to lower their own prices in response to remain competitive.</p>
<h3>Value-add for your brand</h3>
<p>A strategic approach is behind any successful brand protection programme. Through prioritisation, analysts gather actionable data to enforce against large-scale illicit operations to ensure lasting impact<strong>. </strong>If you’d like to discuss in more detail how Incopro analysts can deliver value for your brand using Talisman and their collective expertise, schedule an obligation-free technology demo with one of our specialists below.</p>
