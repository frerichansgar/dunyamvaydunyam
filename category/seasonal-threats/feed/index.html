<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>With e-commerce spending during Black Friday and Singles’ Day growing each year, brand protection teams need to be aware of the latest emerging threats and infringement trends. Read this blog to learn how you can protect your brand and consumers online during the holiday season.</strong></p>



<p>Counterfeiting, phishing, impersonation, and hashtag hijacking are just a handful of the online threats that brands face during the holiday season. And with an environment of fast-moving flash sales and large-scale discounting, it can be difficult to keep up with infringers.</p>



<p><strong>Read this blog to learn</strong>:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#consumer-behavior">The shifts in online consumer behavior</a></li><li><a href="#trends">The holiday infringement trends, including counterfeiting, phishing, and review fraud</a></li><li><a href="#solutions">How brands can protect consumers and key revenue streams</a></li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="consumer-behavior">The shifts in online consumer behavior</h2>



<p>In 2020, the US e-commerce market grew by over 30%, shooting past previous projections[1]. In the same year, US holiday spending reached $100 billion by December[2].&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2021 e-commerce growth has continued at lightning pace. In the US, e-commerce grew by 39.1% in Q1 2021. Comparatively, e-commerce grew by 13.8% in Q1 2020[3]. In Q2 2021, nearly $1 of every $5 spent on retail purchases in the US was online[4].</p>



<p>In the EU, total e-commerce revenues hit US$425.2bn in 2020, an increase of US$71bn from 2019[5]. And in 2021, the market is forecasted to grow by another 9.5%[6]. Brick-and-mortar footfall has shown signs of strong recovery from the pandemic, but its growth rate still lags behind e-commerce at 4.8%[7].</p>



<p>Online buying behavior often differs during the holiday season with consumers snapping up time-limited deals on third party e-commerce sites or marketplaces, instead of seeking out specific brands’ websites.</p>



<p>In China, the annual Singles’ Day e-commerce shopping festival has fueled an explosion in livestream sales. On just the first day of the Alibaba Singles’ Day pre-sales event, Li Jiaqi, a top livestream salesman sold a staggering US$1.9 billion in products and attained nearly 250 million video views[8]. </p>



<p>Deal aggregate websites often see a spike in traffic during the holiday season. These websites redirect to countless external sites, some of which are unfamiliar to the consumer and likely to have been set up only a few days prior. It is difficult for consumers to ascertain the legitimacy of these external sites, and they are at risk of inadvertently visiting scam sites</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="trends">Holiday season infringement trends</h2>



<p>COVID-19 caused widespread disruption to supply chains across the globe, impacting businesses’ ability to fulfill consumer demand. Infringers capitalized on this throughout the pandemic, with cases of falsified and substandard medical products were sold to consumers and, in some cases, even hospitals[9].</p>



<p>In 2021, similar activity has been observed in the run up to the holiday season, where supply from legitimate businesses is unable to meet demand and bad actors are seizing the opportunity to infiltrate marketplaces.</p>



<p>Delays at UK ports will result in toy shortages this Christmas, according to Gary Grant, CEO at UK toy retailer The Entertainer[10]. Infringers are likely to jump at this opportunity to plug the supply gap with fake goods.</p>



<h3>Counterfeits and other infringing listings</h3>



<p>The holiday season is a hotbed for brand infringement. And with the pandemic fueling record e-commerce demand in 2020, infringers were keen to promote their counterfeits and other infringing products to as many consumers as possible.</p>



<p>For example, in the week of Thanksgiving (the run up to Black Friday), compared to a week 3 months back, Incopro’s technology detected the following increases in counterfeit and other infringing listings on popular marketplaces:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="535" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-1024x535.png" alt="Holiday Season Brand Protection Counterfeit Listings" class="wp-image-17767" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-1024x535.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-300x157.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020-768x401.png 768w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-counterfeiting-infringement-2020.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Percentage growth of infringement on Amazon &amp; eBay in the run up to the 2020 holiday season (Incopro data from 2020)</em> [11]</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Phishing scams and impersonation</h3>



<p>During the holiday season, social media platforms are inundated with both legitimate and illegitimate accounts promoting time-limited deals. Consumers may find it difficult to distinguish between the real and the fake, falling prey to impersonation accounts that redirect them to websites operating phishing schemes.</p>



<p>‘Thematic’ phishing scams pose a significant threat to brands and consumers during e-commerce festivals periods such as Black Friday and Singles’ Day. In one case, Facebook accounts masquerading as&nbsp;an FMCG brand&#8217;s official Facebook account were promoting fake giveaways and competitions in order to&nbsp;obtain consumers’ personal data.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="535" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-1024x535.png" alt="Holiday Season Brand Protection Phishing Scams" class="wp-image-17776" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-1024x535.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-300x157.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG-768x401.png 768w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Holiday-phishing-scams-FMCG.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Between October and December 2020, one FMCG brand saw &#8216;competition&#8217; phishing scams&nbsp;grow by 14.5x (1350%) on Facebook (Incopro data from 2020)</em> [12]</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>After the holiday season, the number of anonymized consumer complaints&nbsp;for phishing scams&nbsp;received by the brand reduced swiftly – in January 2021 consumer complaints had dropped by almost 50%&nbsp;compared to December 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Incopro’s analysts detected a large increase in phishing scams targeting a household appliances brand in the run up to Black Friday 2020, compared to 2019. After Black Friday, these websites quickly switched their focus to Christmas themed scams. New Year’s themed websites emerged then soon after.</p>

<h3>Digital ads and hashtag hijacking</h3>



<p>Infringers effectively operate as a primary competitor, undercutting price and hijacking hard-earned brand equity. Without a dedicated strategy to tackle infringers during the holiday season, brands often find themselves with inflated digital spend as they vie for the same advertising space.</p>



<p>Social media advertising and hashtag hijacking are tactics used by bad actors to promote counterfeit and other infringing products during the holiday season. Incopro’s brand protection experts note the increasing use of ‘#blackfriday’ and ‘#promoblackfriday’ in Instagram posts to promote counterfeit products such as watches during the four-week run-up to Black Friday[13].</p>



<p>Bad actors also commonly use holiday-themed hashtags to promote phishing scams to unsuspecting consumers. These scam posts sit alongside posts from genuine accounts within ‘trending categories’ on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, making it difficult for consumers to spot the danger.</p>



<h3>Fake reviews</h3>



<p>97% of shoppers rely on online customer reviews to help make a purchase[14]. In the UK, online reviews influence up to £23 billion of annual consumer spending[15].</p>



<p>Bad actors use fake reviews as a tactic to lend an air of legitimacy to infringing products. Fake reviews pose an issue on global e-commerce and social media platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and Facebook – and even on dedicated review websites such as TripAdvisor.</p>



<p>Sellers manipulate star-rating systems and post positive reviews to push consumers towards purchases. Other popular practices include promising free gifts, vouchers or discounts to customers that leave positive or five-star reviews – this is often against of platforms’ seller policies.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/news/fake-reviews-tripadvisor-slams-facebook-and-google-ceo-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about fake reviews and what platforms can do &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="solutions">Adapt your brand protection strategy for the holiday season</h2>



<h3>Build strong platform relationships</h3>



<p>Platform collaboration should sit as a core tenet of your brand protection strategy. Consider which marketplace or social media platform your customers visit most often and the sellers they purchase your products from. With this data, you can begin to prioritize and develop robust relationships with the platforms that hold the greatest commercial significance.</p>



<p>You should then seek to engage with them directly or through a trusted partner to educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform’s own reputation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/why-platform-relationships-are-critical-to-brand-protection-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about building platform relationships &gt;</a></p>



<h3>Collaborate with marketing and e-commerce functions</h3>



<p>Businesses that are unable to spot trends and threats in advance of the holiday season are unlikely to be able to tackle bad actors at scale; they will be reactive, rather than proactive in their enforcement efforts. They may quickly find themselves racing to the bottom in an attempt to keep up with infringers’ discounting and internal sales targets. Collaboration with your marketing and e-commerce teams is therefore essential to protecting price, profit margins, and brand equity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Through collaboration, you can build an understanding of the platforms that will receive the highest volume of traffic through the holiday season. You can also build a plan of action to protect popular product lines, any new product launches, and promotions during the period.</p>



<p>Additionally, you may be able to identify potential online opportunities for your business such as gaps in your product portfolio, untapped demand in new markets, and emerging e-commerce platforms.</p>

<h3>Harness advanced brand protection technology</h3>



<p>Technology plays a critical role in supporting an effective, year-round online brand protection program. Your team will need to be able to operate at scale, with greater visibility of risks and the ability to automatically detect threats across all channels, extract key data, prioritize targets, and enforce – all at scale.</p>



<p>Incopro Brand Protection Consultant <strong>Tosshan Ramgolam</strong> states: <em>“Listings taking part in e-commerce festivals such as Singles’ Day often feature banner images next to the price. </em>You’ll need brand protection technology that can<strong>&nbsp;</strong>either collect this information from the page source or<strong>&nbsp;</strong>deploys optical character recognition in order to extract the text embedded in these banners.<em> You can then use this data as an indicator for risk to monitor counterfeiting activity for brands.”</em></p>

<h4>Advanced brand protection technology: network analysis</h4>



<p>Your team will also need a solution to find, prioritize, and act against infringer networks that operate across multiple channels. With real time data, you can take down entire networks instead of individual accounts and can significantly impact infringers’ abilities to scale-up promotion in advance of the holiday season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Marketplaces, e-commerce websites and social media platforms are flooded by both fake versions of licensed goods and counterfeit cosmetics in the run up to seasonal events such as Halloween, at the expense of consumer safety and brand reputation.</strong></p>



<p>This Halloween, with festivities predicted to return with a bang and e-commerce spending projected to reach $2.94 billion[1] in the US, businesses are preparing to tackle a record volume of infringement.</p>



<p>It is critical brand protection teams work with platforms and utilize technology to take the fight to infringers and protect both consumers and licensees from ghastly threats.</p>



<p><strong>Read this piece to learn:</strong></p>



<ul><li>How infringers promote products during seasonal events</li><li>Fake costumes trends during Halloween</li><li>Fake cosmetics trends during Halloween</li><li>The brand protection solutions to tackle threats all year round</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-counterfeiters-prey-on-seasonal-sales-and-holidays">COUNTERFEITERS PREY ON SEASONAL SALES AND HOLIDAYS</h2>



<p>In 2020, 52% of US parents sourced Halloween costumes in physical stores[2]. However, this year 55% of parents plan to find costumes online[3], suggesting a continued shift in shopping habits – and a greater risk that consumers end up with fake products.</p>



<p>Bad actors use targeted advertising on social media and promoted listings on marketplaces to offer counterfeit and unlicensed goods to unsuspecting consumers. Adverts offer infringing products a level of credibility, fooling many consumers into thinking they are purchasing goods from official channels.</p>



<p>Infringing listings and scam websites often disappear without a trace after the seasonal demand drops-off, leaving consumers out of pocket and unable to replace their low-quality product in time for the festivities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left has-small-font-size"><em>Spikes in infringing listings for costumes based on characters from popular children’s brands (Incopro, 2021)</em></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-fake-licensed-goods-haunting-marketplaces">FAKE LICENSED GOODS HAUNTING MARKETPLACES</h2>



<p>Each year, online marketplaces are inundated with listings for costumes and props in the run up to Halloween. Some of these are genuine – unfortunately many are not. Often these costumes are based on popular films, TV shows, video games, and comics. Licensees are left helpless as their listings are pushed further and further down marketplace search rankings, with unlicensed merchandise and counterfeits taking their place.</p>



<p>Counterfeit or otherwise unlicensed costumes also put consumers at risk. They are often made with low-quality materials and may easily tear. In October 2021, an online store ‘Mr Gadget Solutions’ based in the UK was recently fined for selling counterfeit children’s costumes that could have posed a fire risk[4]. The costumes – for popular superheroes such as Batman – were sold on eBay for less than £5.</p>



<p>Brands must act. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/living-in-a-fake-society-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incopro research</a> finds that consumers who end up with counterfeits will direct the majority of their criticism at the brand rather than the platform – <strong>52%</strong> of consumers who unintentionally purchase fakes will lose trust in a brand[5].</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-examples-of-spooky-fake-costumes-in-2021">Examples of spooky fake costumes in 2021</h2>



<p>Our brand protection analysts have identified a number of counterfeit and unlicensed costumes heading into Halloween 2021. Popular South-Korean drama Squid Game recently took the streaming world by storm, and a quick scan of eBay and Amazon reveals dozens of high-risk listings.</p>



<p>With Netflix seemingly caught by surprise at the popularity of the show, there is little official merchandise available. Opportunistic infringers have instead filled the gap with unlicensed merchandise, using lifted still images from the hit series and trademarks in their listings.</p>

<p>Other Netflix properties such as Tiger King are still experiencing high levels of infringement over a year after the series aired.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>Example of suspicious listings found on Etsy using the search term ‘Tiger King’ (18th October 2021)</em></p>



<p>Other popular targets include characters such as Lola Bunny from the recent Space Jam sequel and Monkey D. Luffy from the popular anime and manga series One Piece.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full clear-bottom"><img width="1194" height="178" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lola-Bunny-Monkey-D.-Luffy-costume-listings_2021.png" alt="Brand Protection Halloween Fake Costumes eBay" class="wp-image-17693" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lola-Bunny-Monkey-D.-Luffy-costume-listings_2021.png 1194w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lola-Bunny-Monkey-D.-Luffy-costume-listings_2021-300x45.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lola-Bunny-Monkey-D.-Luffy-costume-listings_2021-1024x153.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lola-Bunny-Monkey-D.-Luffy-costume-listings_2021-768x114.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1194px) 100vw, 1194px" /></figure>

<p>Superheroes and villains are prized targets at Halloween. With the recent release of The Suicide Squad in cinemas, infringers have listed costumes and temporary tattoos designed to emulate the look of fan-favorite Harley Quinn. Again, this listing uses lifts imagery from the film’s marketing materials such as posters and promotional stills.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-medium clear-bottom"><img width="275" height="300" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Harley-Quinn-tattoos-listing_2021-275x300.png" alt="Brand Protection Halloween Fake Costumes Harley Quinn" class="wp-image-17686" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Harley-Quinn-tattoos-listing_2021-275x300.png 275w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Harley-Quinn-tattoos-listing_2021.png 352w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" /></figure>

<p>Cosmetics are also a popular target for bad actors. $69 million worth of fake cosmetic and pharmaceutical products were seized in the US in 2017, making up 6.5% of all counterfeit seizures.</p>



<p>Multi-colored lenses are often used as a finishing touch to Halloween costumes. Fake contact lenses are widely available, with PIPCU and the US government warning against their purchase.</p>



<p>Counterfeit contact lenses can be particularly dangerous, either through incorrect usage (contact lenses are usually prescribed) or due to the materials used. Opticians warn that their use can lead to infections, conjunctivitis, and impaired vision[6]. Seized counterfeit contact lenses have even been found to contain toxic materials such as lead[7].</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-brand-protection-solutions-to-tackle-threats-all-year-round">Brand protection solutions to tackle threats all year round</h2>



<p>Platform collaboration should sit as a core tenet of your brand protection strategy. Consider which marketplace or social media platform your customers visit most often and the sellers they purchase your products from. You&#8217;ll also need to be cognisant of the platforms used by your licensees to sell their goods. With this data, you can begin to prioritize and develop robust relationships with the platforms that hold the greatest commercial significance.</p>



<p>You should then seek to engage with them directly or through a trusted partner. The following checklist is useful to kick off your relationship building exercise:</p>



<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts within the platforms’ support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;</li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;</li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;and interact with the relevant representatives where the platform has local websites</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-advanced-online-brand-protection-technology-critical-to-success">Advanced online brand protection technology critical to success</h3>



<p>It is critical to deploy <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/online-brand-protection/talisman-brand-protection-software/">online brand protection technology</a> that works in tandem with platform tools to tackle infringements such as counterfeit or unlicensed costumers at scale, but also:</p>



<ul><li>Collects more data on the individuals exploiting your brand</li><li>Prioritizes high-risk listings that your consumers are most likely to find</li><li>Makes the connection between brand exploiters operating across multiple channels and regions</li></ul>



<p>The following are some of the key indicators used to identify and prioritize infringements:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Price</strong>&nbsp;– fake costumes are listed for prices as low as £3.99 to undercut genuine listings</li><li><strong>Typos or grammatical mistakes within the listing</strong> –&nbsp;spelling mistakes of the product or brand name are intentional to deceive consumers</li><li><strong>Seller address and item location</strong> –&nbsp;the listing may claim to be domestic stock but is actually shipped from overseas (or if the seller’s business address is registered overseas)</li><li><strong>Text embedded within listing images</strong> – infringers may embed information such as price, contact details, and product description to avoid keyword detection. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/online-brand-protection/automation-image-technology/">Optical character recognition technology</a> will extract this information.</li></ul>
