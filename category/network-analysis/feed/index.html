<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The business models and tactics deployed to hijack businesses&#8217; digital channels have become increasingly sophisticated – it’s critical that your team is equipped with the tools and knowledge to remain one step ahead.</strong></p>



<p>In a poll of Brand Protection professionals <strong>69%</strong> stated that when planning their strategy, they either haven’t considered the business models of bad actors or find it hard to understand / get visibility of them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="414" height="268" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Poll-results-Planning-Brand-Protection-strategy-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11719" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Poll-results-Planning-Brand-Protection-strategy-1.png 414w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Poll-results-Planning-Brand-Protection-strategy-1-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></figure>



<p>By building an understanding of bad actors&#8217; operating models and uncovering their online networks, brands can maintain consumer trust and maximize the opportunity offered by&nbsp;e-commerce.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" style="color:#009ca6">Part 1:&nbsp;The threats posed by bad actors online to your business and its consumers</h2>



<p>The business models deployed by bad actors most often mimic those of legitimate businesses.&nbsp;Bad actors will also often share the same strategic considerations when they go to market and promote products, utilizing the same digital channels and tools.</p>



<p>The changing online and commercial environment changes the way they adapt, like any business.&nbsp;This is also true when enforcement activity changes their behavior.</p>



<h3 id="h-seasonal-trend-and-enforcement-based-changes-in-bad-actors-behavior">Seasonal, trend, and enforcement-based changes in bad actors’ behavior</h3>



<p>Bad actors’ behavior is constantly changing in response to events that can impact their sales and ability to operate.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“Changes&nbsp;I commonly observe&nbsp;can be&nbsp;based on similar things to legitimate business: seasons/holidays/trends in the social environment. Bad actors also&nbsp;change as a reaction to&nbsp;enforcement.”</strong></p><cite>Alex Shad, Brand Protection Team Lead, Incopro</cite></blockquote>



<p>With Seasonal events such as Easter, Halloween, and Christmas, bad actors will emulate genuine brand behavior&nbsp;on social media, marketplaces, and websites. With cases of phishing, fraud, and impersonation, bad actors attempt to make their social posts and websites appear genuine to trick consumers. They will also combine this with the use of redirects and other entities that look legitimate to divert consumers.</p>



<p>Bad actors will also react to the social climate. For example, they started producing face masks&nbsp;during the coronavirus pandemic – as seen <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/how-agile-infringer-networks-restructure-and-avoid-enforcement/">in this network example</a>.</p>



<p>Enforcement is also a key driver, with behavior depending on issue type:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fraud/impersonation</strong> – enforcement is more likely to&nbsp;scare bad actors into hiding. They will depopulate&nbsp;enforceable pages and then repopulate&nbsp;very quickly without notice&nbsp;to disseminate scams. They may also set up personal profiles to later populate if they are expecting enforcement on pages that are currently live.</li><li><strong>Traditional trademark infringement</strong> – After enforcement, bad actors&nbsp;are more likely to change the way in which they infringe as opposed to changing their business model. The seller may blur over the infringing elements&nbsp;of images or&nbsp;appear to cease the sale of certain products.</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-bad-actors-are-often-agile-operators-that-adopt-emerging-platforms"><strong>Bad actors are often agile operators that adopt emerging platforms</strong></h3>



<p>Bad actors can be more dynamic than legitimate businesses at entering new markets and deploying new technology as they have lower barriers to entry. Counterfeiters, in particular, make use of new emerging platforms and have used influencer culture to their advantage.</p>



<p>TikTok, a user-generated content (UGC) platform that has enjoyed huge growth over the last year, is a good example – it has seen over 2 billion downloads in it’s first 4 years since launch, with Q1 2020 seeing over 315m&nbsp;downloads alone. TikTok’s primary audience is younger consumers, who are quicker to adopt newer media formats. Bad actors have latched onto this platform and often use influencers, who lend an aura of authenticity, to promote their goods to large swathes of consumers.</p>



<h3 id="h-bad-actors-are-one-step-ahead-in-reacting-to-market-trends">Bad actors are one step ahead in reacting to market trends</h3>



<p>Bad actors will also often be one step ahead of legitimate companies in reacting to market trends. An example of this is product unboxing videos – bad actors sometimes enlist the help of prominent influencers on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube to unbox their counterfeit products, highlighting key features and build quality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="650" height="427" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Example-of-counterfeit-unboxing-on-YouTube.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11723" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Example-of-counterfeit-unboxing-on-YouTube.jpg 650w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Example-of-counterfeit-unboxing-on-YouTube-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure>



<p>When reacting to wider market trends, they do not adhere to rules, regulations, or legal frameworks, meaning they can create and market new product lines far faster than legitimate companies.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" style="color:#009ca6">Part 2:&nbsp;The models used to capture consumers, and how to disrupt them&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We will look at 3 different types of network to illustrate how&nbsp;they are structured and how you can tackle them:&nbsp;</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Simple network: marketplace seller connected by WeChat&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Traditional counterfeiting&nbsp;network&nbsp;selling luxury watches</li><li>Multichannel network selling flavored vaping liquids&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h3 id="h-1-simple-network-shopee-storefronts-seller-connected-by-wechat">1. Simple network – Shopee storefronts seller connected by WeChat</h3>



<p>In this example, Incopro analysts discovered a network selling counterfeit goods that pose a health risk to consumers.</p>



<p><strong>Key features of the network:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Marketplace seller found to be offering infringing items which posed a health risk to consumers</li><li>WeChat ID connected the account to 32 other storefronts on the same platform</li><li>Auditing these connected storefronts could reveal further issues for the brand</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="366" height="335" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11730" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-1.png 366w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-1-300x275.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></figure>



<p>The network is comprised of multiple&nbsp;Shopee storefronts all connected by one single WeChat account&nbsp;– without using <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/whiteboard/network-analysis/">Network Analysis technology</a>, these storefronts would have been encountered one by one without&nbsp;the&nbsp;link ever being made,&nbsp;removing the possibility for&nbsp;coordinated enforcement causing max disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using this link, Incopro analysts can search and ‘audit’ each linked storefront and screen&nbsp;these for similar infringements or references to the relevant brands.&nbsp;If other infringements are found, these can be collected for enforcement as one notice through the Shopee webform.&nbsp;An additional benefit of&nbsp;coordinated enforcement on individual sellers is the increased chance the platform would proactively deactivate the whole storefront.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-large-scale-network-selling-counterfeit-luxury-watch-network">2. Large-scale network selling counterfeit luxury watch network</h3>



<p>In this example, Incopro discovered a typical counterfeiting network offering luxury watches predominantly via websites. The network was multinational in nature,&nbsp;with a global supply chain which centered on China.</p>



<p><strong>Key features of the network:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Large scale network containing 216 websites connected by 8 common email addresses (3 China-based and 5 international)</li><li>These networks primarily use traditional search methods to attract traffic&nbsp;</li><li>Targeted multiple brands owned by a number of different businesses, indicating a broad network (other brands targeted: Rolex, Breitling, Timberland, UGG)</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="378" height="370" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11726" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-2.png 378w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-2-300x294.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></figure>



<p>Coordinated action against all of the entities within the network is one method to effectively disrupt&nbsp;its operation. With most of the network’s customers arriving via organic search, Google’s URL delisting tool could also come in to play to starve the network of its traffic source. Equally, due to the large scale of the network, offline action with legal partners would also be an effective strategy to tackle the perpetrators.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-multichannel-network-selling-vaping-products">3. Multichannel Network&nbsp;selling vaping products </h3>



<p>In this example, vaping liquid products were sold via websites and marketplaces with promotional pages on social media.</p>



<p><strong>Key features of the network:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Complex network with multiple storefronts and websites</li><li>Domains&nbsp;connected by&nbsp;a&nbsp;company&nbsp;that supports website &amp; online store set up and synchronization</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="399" height="284" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11732" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-3.png 399w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Network-example-3-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></figure>



<p>Connections made by Network Analysis technology allow for all marketplace listings, social media posts, and domain URLs to be enforced at once, leaving the bad actor with no opportunity to change product listings. The Domains&nbsp;that are connected by&nbsp;the website set-up company&nbsp;can then be forwarded to the Investigations Services team to build further intelligence.</p>



<h3 id="h-incopro-case-study-offline-action-disrupting-counterfeit-jewelry-network-in-china">Incopro Case Study: Offline action disrupting counterfeit jewelry network in China</h3>



<p>One core avenue to dismantling bad actor networks is coordinated offline action in liaison with local authorities and law enforcement agencies.</p>



<p>In 2018, a counterfeiting&nbsp;ring that peddled high-value&nbsp;jewelry&nbsp;(average&nbsp;price $8,000) across popular online marketplaces was discovered by Incopro’s analysts. Test-purchases&nbsp;were used to gather identifying information on the perpetrators, with the wider case being built using&nbsp;data gathered from Taobao, Weibo, and WeChat. Subsequent offline action led to over 50&nbsp;arrests and seizure of products across seven&nbsp;addresses.</p>



<p>Multilateral action is key&nbsp;to more effective offline action. In China, the close relationship between CBBC (China Britain Business Council) and platforms such as Alibaba now make offline investigations easier to undertake.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" style="color:#009ca6">Part 3:&nbsp;How Network Analysis technology can help you address these threats effectively&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/network-analysis/">Network Analysis</a> is a core module of Incopro’s Brand Protection platform <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Talisman</a> that powers a strategic approach to tackling networks.&nbsp;By connecting infringing entities across channels such as websites, marketplaces, and social media – and matching them against online and offline identifiers – Network Analysis gives you full visibility of the risks to your brands, prioritizes them by threat level, and provides you with the insights to act on them at scale.</p>



<p><strong>There are four key components to Incopro’s Network Analysis technology that enable you to tackle the most damaging threats to your business:</strong></p>



<h4 id="h-1-good-quality-data-meaningful-networks">1. GOOD QUALITY DATA = MEANINGFUL NETWORKS</h4>



<ul><li>Processes for cleaning and validating data before networks are built</li><li>Algorithms to make networks more meaningful, e.g. take out nodes with too many links</li><li>All useful data points extracted, both structured and unstructured</li><li>Inferred links based on similarities – helps uncover potentially connected nodes</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-2-contextualized-threats-in-the-universe-of-networks">2. CONTEXTUALIZED THREATS IN THE ‘UNIVERSE’ OF NETWORKS</h4>



<ul><li>Threat score to prioritize and assess each network</li><li>Take into account popularity, action taken and the risk from the network’s component parts</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-3-tools-to-search-manipulate-and-edit">3. TOOLS TO SEARCH, MANIPULATE AND EDIT</h4>



<ul><li>Search and filter clusters on a wide variety of data points</li><li>Compare networks to understand the bigger picture</li><li>Add and remove nodes and links to build out your online and offline intelligence picture</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-4-impactful-enforcement-from-the-network-view">4. IMPACTFUL ENFORCEMENT FROM THE NETWORK VIEW</h4>



<ul><li>Identify key enablers to dismantle all or part of the network, as your strategy directs</li><li>Tackle the whole network and see how it responds&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-when-to-use-network-analysis-within-your-workflow">When to use Network Analysis within your workflow</h3>



<p>The tool&nbsp;has the potential to be used&nbsp;as both&nbsp;a&nbsp;principal&nbsp;resource for online action and a supplementary&nbsp;resource for further enforcement.&nbsp;Brand owners can filter through high-risk networks&nbsp;and networks that include tagged objects.&nbsp;This includes checking connections made with official entities.</p>



<p>Brand owners can then screen, tag and enforce infringements outside of the tool&nbsp;and then filter for those tags and enforcements in Network Analysis. This can open the door to a possible string of previously unseen connections and sellers to be targeted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is beneficial if&nbsp;a team needs to focus on multiple online issues&nbsp;at any one time. It is also useful where issues are more ‘trends’&nbsp;that spread across a number of sellers and are therefore not specific to a single bad actor.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;novel issues or&nbsp;issues&nbsp;where sellers are known to change their behavior quickly, the preferred workflow would be enforcing all infringing items in a network at once.</p>

<p>Network Analysis gives you insight&nbsp;into the&nbsp;different&nbsp;networks&nbsp;that are&nbsp;hijacking your brand and exploiting consumers.&nbsp;By building a full picture of these networks&nbsp;and prioritizing based on threat, we can&nbsp;drive&nbsp;enforcement&nbsp;and investigations&nbsp;in a more strategic,&nbsp;impactful way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>We revisit a large-scale infringer network selling counterfeit soccer merchandise to see how it has evolved over time and how it continues to operate despite enforcement attempts by a third party.</strong></p>



<p>In this piece, we explore how the network’s structure has rapidly changed to reach consumers and avoid enforcement. We then look at how the owners have responded to market changes – specifically the creation of ‘branded’ face masks in light of the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, we highlight how an intelligence-led approach will allow you to enforce at a network level to shut down similar operations that target your brand.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-an-infringer-network">What is an infringer network?</h3>



<p>First, some context on infringer networks. Criminals often act as part of wider interconnected networks that are akin to large, multinational businesses in the way they operate – they have suppliers, distribution channels, run marketing campaigns and ‘employ’ individuals to promote the products.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-do-infringer-networks-operate">How do infringer networks operate?</h3>



<p>Bad actors utilize a combination of digital channels including social media, marketplaces, and e-commerce websites to sell their illegal products to large volumes of consumers.</p>



<p>Large-scale counterfeit networks are known to evolve very rapidly to counteract enforcement efforts and are adept in shrugging off ad-hoc takedowns. Utilizing a number of different domains, accounts, and listings, bad actors react quickly to channels that are closed down &#8211; they are quickly replaced and the counterfeiting activity continues.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-1-evolution-of-an-infringer-network" style="color:#009ca6">Part 1: Evolution of an infringer network</h2>



<p>Over the last 5 years, Incopro has monitored a large-scale network that distributes counterfeit soccer shirts/jerseys, tracksuits, socks and vests. We’ve documented its behavioral changes to see how it reaches consumers and the methods it has employed to successfully avoided enforcement techniques from third parties.</p>



<h3 id="h-2016-the-network-spreads">2016 – The network spreads</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/the-rise-of-social-media-in-counterfeiting-uefa-euro-2016-football-shirts/">In 2016</a>, the network &#8212; already in existence for several years &#8212; began to expand its operation in the run up to the 2016 European Championships. We identified 80 connecting parts with clear linkage to one company operating by selling fake soccer shirts:</p>



<ul><li>47 website domains (at the time, 27 were active)</li><li>17 Social Media Accounts:<ul><li>4 x Facebook</li><li>3 x Skype</li><li>3 x WhatsApp</li><li>3 x Twitter</li><li>1 x Pinterest</li><li>1 x Google+</li><li>1 x YouTube</li><li>1 x LinkedIn</li></ul></li><li>1 Marketplace Store</li><li>17 email addresses</li></ul>



<p>The network’s structure at the time is mapped below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized clear-top"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Counterfeiting-network.png" alt="Counterfeiting network" class="wp-image-895" width="580" height="480" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Counterfeiting-network.png 700w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Counterfeiting-network-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><figcaption>Blue highlighting indicates the ad-hoc enforcement attempts by a third party which did little to disrupt the network</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-2018-the-network-responds-to-enforcement-attempts">2018 – The network responds to enforcement attempts</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/counterfeit-networks-operate/">During the 2018 World Cup</a>, there was little wholesale change to the structure of the network &#8211; we identified six Facebook accounts and thirty-three websites, although very few of them were the same as had been operating previously.</p>



<p>Throughout the tournament our analysts noted that if a website was closed, the social media accounts simply switched their promotion efforts to another within the network and the infringement continued unhindered.</p>



<h3 id="h-2020-the-network-consolidates-its-internal-structure-and-starts-hijacking-genuine-websites-to-promote-counterfeits">2020 – The network consolidates its internal structure and starts hijacking genuine websites to promote counterfeits</h3>



<p>In 2020, the network continues to evolve. The key changes in behavior that we have observed over the last year include:</p>



<ul><li>The owners have stopped using brands within domain name as these were easy to identify and take down using trademark law</li><li>The owners are now using hacked genuine websites to divert traffic to their storefront</li><li>The operation is now consolidated to 4 main mirror websites – down from almost 50 two years ago</li><li>The network now promotes face masks with club insignia printed on the fabric – in response to COVID-19</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-use-of-hijacked-websites">Use of hijacked websites</h3>



<p>We identified that the owners of this network are hacking into WordPress-based websites to redirect traffic to their storefronts.</p>



<p>They create new pages that contain ‘cheap football shirts’ or similar within the URL slug and the page header so that they will appear for these searches. These pages are then subsequently indexed by search engines, at which point the hacker removes the pages from the website. When a user visits these hacked URLs via a search engine, they immediately hit a 404 page which has been set to redirect to the counterfeiter’s storefronts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top"><img width="637" height="379" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hijacked-websites-statistics.png" alt="Hijacked websites statistics" class="wp-image-8448" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hijacked-websites-statistics.png 637w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hijacked-websites-statistics-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /><figcaption>This sophisticated hacking operation targets websites across a wide range of industries and is designed to ensure the counterfeit shopfronts receive traffic from consumers across the globe</figcaption></figure>



<p>The network’s owners have targeted a number of websites from a variety of territories to hijack. As the map below shows, hijacked websites are based in countries across all continents. As a result, the network’s storefronts are able to maximise their global reach.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="455" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Global-map-of-hijacked-sites-1024x455.png" alt="Global map of hijacked sites" class="wp-image-8447" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Global-map-of-hijacked-sites-1024x455.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Global-map-of-hijacked-sites-300x133.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Global-map-of-hijacked-sites-768x341.png 768w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Global-map-of-hijacked-sites.png 1318w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Most of the hijacked websites identified are located in the US, UK, and Germany</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-brands-targeted-by-network"><strong>Brands targeted by network</strong></h3>



<p>We looked at the scale of infringement and types of products on offer to get an accurate idea of the number of brands affected by the network. We found the following number of entities were impacted directly or indirectly:</p>



<ul><li>League/Other football competitions: 15</li><li>Teams: 256</li><li>Kit suppliers: 32</li><li>Sponsors (all sponsors): 226</li><li>Payment providers: 4</li><li>Shipping providers: 3</li></ul>



<p>Although some of these brands are not being counterfeited directly (I.e. a kit sponsor has been removed from a counterfeit jersey or pair of shorts), association with this criminal industry alone has a negative impact on brand reputation – some operations have been shown to directly fund serious crimes such as terrorism and <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/the-true-cost-of-counterfeit-goods/">human trafficking</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-facemasks-new-products-hijacking-demand-created-by-covid-19"><strong>Facemasks: New products hijacking demand created by COVID-19</strong></h3>



<p>Infringers will adapt and exploit any change in the market.</p>



<p>Since the postponement of the 2020 European Championship due to COVID-19, the network’s owners have had to find another event or trend to produce new merchandise for.</p>



<p>Social distancing measures are gradually easing, but the use of face masks by the general public will likely remain. It is widely expected that spectators will be required to wear face masks for their own safety when they are allowed to return to sports matches. In some countries, including the UK, the general public is also mandated to wear face masks on public transport &#8211; fans may also want to wear their team’s colors when traveling.</p>



<p>Face masks, therefore, have proved to be the perfect product trend for this network to latch onto.</p>



<p>Counterfeit soccer kit poses risks to brand reputations and revenues. However, illegitimate face masks go one step further and put consumers’ health at serious risk. Undergoing no testing or certification and tied directly to the brand and sponsors, these masks are likely to be completely ineffectual in protecting the wearer and others around them from COVID-19.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-2-how-to-take-down-large-scale-networks" style="color:#009ca6">Part 2: How to take down large-scale networks</h2>



<p>Focus your resources on identifying and enforcing against large-scale networks &#8211;&nbsp;the biggest threats to a brand are well organized infringer networks that can infiltrate consumer touchpoints wherever they are based in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Equip your business with the technology to monitor their digital activity &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>Infringer networks’ online operations and activity&nbsp;leaves a&nbsp;data footprint, despite best efforts to cover their tracks.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ensure this technology can connect&nbsp;the&nbsp;data&nbsp;from all&nbsp;sources&nbsp;–</strong>&nbsp;Not only do you need to detect&nbsp;the data&nbsp;but you also need to connect the&nbsp;right data&nbsp;together to build a true picture of the size and reach of a network. Networks&nbsp;may&nbsp;operate across countless&nbsp;identities, websites,&nbsp;social media accounts, seller&nbsp;profiles,&nbsp;channels &amp; platforms.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Train your technology to detect similar activity and relationships to expose the network’s scale and predict future behavior –&nbsp;</strong>The key to staying ahead of infringers is being able to predict their next moves&nbsp;and respond appropriately.</li></ul>



<p>Technology needs human guidance, however.&nbsp;Brand Protection experts are needed at two key points:&nbsp;<strong>1) building and optimizing the network models at the front end&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>2) determining action that should take both online and offline once you have found a network.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Criminals often act as part of wider interconnected networks, spanning countless online channels and consumer touchpoints across the globe.</p>



<p>As counterfeiters have evolved and established these sophisticated multi-channel operations, it has become critical to enforce at a network level to have a lasting impact. We look at the techniques used to identify criminal networks, highlighting how an intelligence-led approach will allow your brand to shut down these operations for good.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-do-networks-operate">How do networks operate?</h3>



<p>Bad actors utilize a combination of social media, marketplaces and ecommerce websites to sell their illegal merchandise to large volumes of consumers. As part of this approach, they often funnel consumers to these websites via their social media to complete transactions.</p>



<p>Large-scale counterfeit networks are known to evolve very rapidly to counteract enforcement efforts and are adept in shrugging off ad-hoc takedowns. Utilizing a number of different domains, accounts, and listings, bad actors react quickly to channels that are closed down, they are quickly replaced and the counterfeiting activity continues.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-case-study-an-evolving-network-targeting-football-licensees">Case study: An evolving network targeting football licensees</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns heading-branded">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>We monitored a network during the 2016 European Championship which sold counterfeit football jerseys. After revisiting this network, we noted that it was still active and utilizing a similar business model during the 2018 World Cup, with continued reliance on the same distribution and promotion channels. The network contained many domains, email addresses, social media accounts and was associated with a number of offline identities.</p>



<p>Whilst the business model remained the same, the ecommerce sites used to sell the shirts had changed. Many that we had previously identified had been closed down and re-opened under slightly varied URLs, containing the same contact information.</p>



<p>We also identified six Facebook accounts and thirty-three websites connected to this network, although very few of them were the same as had been operating previously. Throughout the tournament, our analysts noticed that if a website was closed, the social media platforms simply switched their promotion efforts to another within the network and the infringement continued unhindered.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3 id="h-ad-hoc-enforcement-by-external-party-was-ineffective">Ad-hoc enforcement by external party was ineffective </h3>



<p>Enforcement by an external party against single entities within the network suggests that there had been an ongoing battle, but both the nature and scale of the issue was not understood by those trying to close them down. The counterfeiters did not diversify how they promoted or distributed goods, and they did not switch their personal accounts or contact details which implies they did not feel threatened by the enforcement efforts.</p>



<p>This would have been problematic for the brand owners or licensees trying to grapple with the network. With the same distribution framework still intact, the infringers would have been able to freely promote sales and gain repeat purchases. The sellers would have also been able to build up a reliable reputation facilitating the further distribution of counterfeits.</p>

<h3 id="h-how-to-fight-large-scale-networks">How to fight large-scale networks</h3>



<p>Taking an intelligence-led approach to fighting large-scale counterfeiting networks is the only truly effective way to shut down these operations. Incopro uses advanced &#8216;Network Analysis&#8217; technology to achieve this. By connecting all elements within the network across over 20 data points such as social media accounts, website domains, and marketplace listings and matching key identifying information such as seller premises, telephone numbers, and email addresses, we can build a complete picture of the operation.</p>



<p>Talisman, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Incopro&#8217;s Brand Protection platform</a>, features in-built prioritization technology that indicates which networks pose the greatest threat to your brand, allowing you to focus your efforts and generate maximum impact.

<p>Network Analysis provides insight into how bad actors use multiple channels and accounts to boost sales. We trace links between all these separate accounts and enforce at scale to take out the whole network rather than engaging in ‘whack-a-mole&#8217;. This addresses the source of the issue to bring long-lasting results for brands.</p>



<h3 id="h-taking-down-a-network-in-24-hours">Taking down a network in 24 hours</h3>



<p>In early 2018, an Instagram account promoting counterfeit goods for a leading sports licensor was discovered. Talisman identified the full network, containing over 530 social media accounts, 14,140 infringing URLs, and over 7,000 marketplace listings, and successfully enforced against the entire operation within 24 hours. This comprehensive action cleaned up marketplaces and social media platforms, allowing genuine licensees to <strong>regain online market share</strong> and <strong>put a stop to the erosion of revenues</strong> on these digital channels. </p>



<p>Incopro constantly monitors networks such as the one identified above, so we can continue to understand the behavior of counterfeiters and identify any new trends, ensuring we stay ahead of the curve and deliver real impact that to defend our customers’ brand online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Using the 2018 World Cup as an example, we explore the range of counterfeit networks and large-scale issues that can face your brand online and how you can tackle the issue.</h2>
<p>We look at one of the most critical pieces in the Brand Protection landscape &#8211; Network Analysis &#8211; and how an intelligence-led approach allows brands to shut down large-scale infringer networks for good. For Euro 2016 (the football European Championships for our non-Europe based readers) we have conducted a similar piece of research that details the <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/blog/the-rise-of-social-media-in-counterfeiting-uefa-euro-2016-football-shirts"><strong>networks behind the distribution of counterfeit football jerseys.</strong></a></p>
<p>Due to the complex nature of infringer networks, we break this down into two articles. In this post we explain why Network Analysis is critical, re-evaluate the same network discovered during Euro 2016 and present our key findings. <span style="color: #009ca6;"><strong><a style="color: #009ca6;" href="https://www.incoproip.com/blog/counterfeit-networks-operate">Our second post</a> </strong></span>provides a deeper analysis of the network, exploring it in detail before explaining how best to combat it.</p>
<h3>What is Network Analysis?</h3>
<p>Network Analysis is the technique of connecting seemingly unconnected infringers to one another and creating a network demonstrating the size and scope of the problem. This identifies large scale infringers / counterfeit networks operating online and offline, uncovers their business models, and allows enforcement at scale, causing maximum damage to illegal operations.</p>
<p>Our re-evaluation of the network monitored during Euro 2016 showed that it is still active and utilizing a similar business model with their use of distribution and promotion channels. It contained many domains, email addresses, social media accounts, and even offline information such as real-life identities.</p>
<h3>The evolution of the network</h3>
<p>Whilst the business model remained the same, the e-shops they use to sell the shirts had changed. Many that we had previously identified had been closed down and re-opened under slightly varied URLs, containing the same contact information.</p>
<p>These closures suggest that there has been a battle against the network, but that the nature or the scale of the issue is not understood by those trying to close them down. The counterfeiters have not diversified how they promote or distribute goods, or switched their personal accounts and available details which shows they do not feel threatened by the current enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>This is problematic for those who are trying to shut them down. With the same distribution framework still intact, it is easy for the infringers to continue to promote sales and gain repeat custom. It also allows these sellers to build up a reliable reputation facilitating the further distribution of counterfeits.</p>
<h3>The impact of Network Analysis</h3>
<p>You are only able to get on top of the problem with a comprehensive understanding of the counterfeiter’s network. If this battle had taken place with Network Analysis and an intelligence-led strategy then it could have been taken out in one fell swoop, ensuring serious setbacks rather than minor inconveniences.</p>
<p>Building network visualizations allows us to understand how their social media combines with marketplace listings or e-shops to boost sales. When we trace links between all these separate accounts we aim to take out the whole network, preventing the ability for replacements to spring up instantaneously.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/blog/counterfeit-networks-operate">In our second piece,</a></strong> we dive into the details of this network and provide a deeper analysis of the findings.</p>
