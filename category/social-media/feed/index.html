										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2021 posed unique challenges to brand protection teams, with online threats increasingly varied, supply chains disrupted, and department budgets tightening.</strong></p>



<p>Throughout this year however, members of the global brand protection community INSYNC remained resolute in their goal to protect consumers, with teams continually adapting to the fast-evolving online environment. Quotes and insights from the INSYNC community show teams responding to prolonged global uncertainty and shifts in online behavior by refocusing strategy, collaborating with internal teams, and building relationships with e-commerce platforms.</p>



<p>Read this blog to learn about the key developments within the industry in 2021, including emerging threats, new legislation, and innovative approaches to brand protection strategy.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Emerging threats in 2021</h2>



<p>The pandemic has continued to disrupt supply chains across the globe, meaning consumers have had difficulty in obtaining certain branded products. Counterfeiters and other bad actors have seized this opportunity to impersonate brands and defraud consumers.</p>



<h3 id="h-social-media-phishing-and-scams">Social media phishing and scams</h3>



<p>Brands in 2021 faced a growing tide of phishing scams and other types of fraud targeting their customers on social media.</p>



<p>Social media cybercrime generates a staggering&nbsp;<strong>$3.25</strong> billion&nbsp;for criminal networks annually[1]. <strong>61%</strong> of companies&nbsp;experience phishing attacks via their social media channels[2]. And as social media usage continues to increase, scammers have sought new methods to exploit brands and consumers.</p>



<p>Facebook and Instagram have emerged as popular platforms for fake ‘brand giveaways’, where scammers impersonate well-known brands advertising offering free product giveaways. Once consumers submit their personal information, the scammers use this to conduct identity and financial fraud.</p>



<p>In a sign of growing frustration from authorities, the&nbsp;head of enforcement at the FCA (UK) stated:</p>



<p><em>“Social media sites are effectively a gateway in which scammers are getting access to vast numbers of people in the population through online searches.”[3]</em></p>



<p>While platforms are taking steps to combat scammers, it is clear they can go further. Businesses too must adapt their brand protection strategies to safeguard consumers’ digital safety and trust on social media as threats continue to grow.</p>

<h3>COVID-related scams</h3>



<p>Brands and consumers contended with a barrage of COVID-related scams and fake products during 2021. These threats included:</p>



<h4>Listings for COVID vaccines on B2B &amp; B2C marketplaces</h4>



<p>Incopro’s experts have detected several unauthorized listings claiming to be ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Direct Suppliers’ on B2B platforms EC21, Ecplaza, and Tradekey. With the listings not directly referring to branded vaccines, identifying the key platforms sellers use to advertise these fake or unauthorized products plays a significant role in proactive enforcement.</p>



<p>COVID vaccine listings can often also be found on B2C platforms such as eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist. These usually involve sellers offering slots to get the vaccine. COVID vaccine manufacturers have confirmed to Incopro that the majority of these online offers are scams.</p>



<h4>Criminals selling COVID-related products</h4>



<p>Fake vaccine passports / certificates and even COVID test results are being sold on e-commerce websites and, increasingly, the dark web[4].</p>



<p>Law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) in the US are pursuing false COVID-related products and are notifying registrars when their services are used by bad actors. However, with over 1,000 COVID-related domains being registered per day, it’s clear that registrars and web hosts need to do more.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Legislation targeting platforms – EU</h2>



<p>On the legislative front 2021 heralded many promising changes, with increased pressure placed on e-commerce platforms and other online intermediaries.</p>



<p>In December 2020, The European Commission published its much-anticipated&nbsp;Digital Services Act package of measures<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;in what may amount potentially to the most sweeping reforms to tech regulation in Europe for more than two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two separate pieces of legislation (the&nbsp;Digital Services Act&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Digital Markets Act) appear to signify the arrival of root and branch reform to the Internet platform economy, assuming the draft texts are adopted by the European Parliament and are enacted into law.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The Digital Services Act (DSA)</h3>



<p>The DSA is designed to regulate the way in which platforms handle illegal or harmful content in their capacity as intermediaries which connect consumers with goods, services and content.</p>



<p>A central theme to the DSA is the notion that technology companies will need now to take much more responsibility for unlawful behavior on their platforms – and will face serious financial penalties if they do not.</p>



<p>While brand owners welcome the proposed legislation, there are several key improvements that are needed. Perhaps most critical of these are:</p>



<ul><li>Trusted Flaggers – ‘Trusted Flagger’ rules should apply to all hosting services and trusted flagger status should be available to all entities which demonstrate expertise and a high rate of accuracy when flagging content regardless of whether or not they are part of trade associations or collective bodies.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Repeat Infringers – The scope of this provision is too narrow; it needs to apply to all hosting services (e.g. cyberlockers). It should also permit the termination of the provision of services in egregious cases – for example in cases of repeated suspension.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/the-digital-services-act-what-do-brand-and-content-owners-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about DSA changes requested by brand owners &gt;</a></p>



<h3>The Digital Markets Act (DMA)</h3>



<p>In contrast to the DSA,&nbsp;the DMA&nbsp;applies to large online platforms which act as “Gatekeepers” in digital markets – acting as critical gateways for business users to reach end users (consumers). This includes search engines, intermediation services, social networking services, video-sharing platforms, operating systems, interpersonal communication services, cloud computing and advertising[6].</p>



<p>The DMA seeks to regulate these platforms to ensure that the markets in which they operate remain fair and competitive. The DMA imposes restrictions and obligations to ensure that Gatekeeper platforms behave in a fair way online.</p>

<h2 class="heading-branded">Legislation targeting platforms – US</h2>



<p>Similar trends were observed in the US, with legislators increasing looking at the role of platforms and online intermediaries in facilitating the sale or access of infringing products and services.</p>



<h3>The Shop Safe Act</h3>



<p>The US Shop Safe Act Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 (The Lanham Act), with the addition of a section to make e-commerce platforms liable for trademark infringement and counterfeiting if they do not follow a number of best practices such as screening sellers and enforcing against repeat infringers.</p>



<h3>The INFORM Consumers Act</h3>



<p>The US INFORM Consumers Act (The Integrity, Notification, and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers), requires online marketplaces to collect, verify and disclose certain information from high-volume third-party sellers.</p>



<p>Following discussions in the senate, e-commerce platforms lobbied to define high-volume third-party sellers to include those that conduct 200 or more transactions resulting in total revenues of $7,000 or more during a continuous 12-month period.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/shop-safe-inform-consumers-act-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about US legislative developments &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Increased focus on repeat infringers</h2>



<p>In early 2021 Incopro released ‘Three Strikes and Out’, a white paper that explores how e-commerce platforms can tackle repeat infringers – an issue that brand owners are increasingly highlighting.</p>



<p>We found that <strong>23</strong> of the <strong>34</strong> e-commerce platforms considered have a policy directed at repeat infringers. The remaining <strong>11</strong> had no relevant policy evident. Out of the <strong>23</strong> e-commerce platforms that have a policy, only 3 had enacted a three-strikes rule.</p>



<p>We noted that platforms that do have a clear ‘three strikes’ rule and robust seller verification process – such as Aliexpress – see fewer repeat infringements than other platforms.</p>



<p>The white paper analyzed over 1.5m enforcements to help understand the scale of the issue, before setting out how brands, platforms and legislators can address the challenge to protect consumers, reduce losses suffered to counterfeiting and support rights holders.</p>



<p>Incopro’s analysis shows that:</p>



<ul><li>Only&nbsp;<strong>6%</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;sellers&nbsp;are&nbsp;repeatedly enforced on <strong>3 days</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>more</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>However, these sellers are responsible for over&nbsp;<strong>24%</strong>&nbsp;of the listings Incopro has enforced against&nbsp;</li><li>The models show that&nbsp;a seller verification and repeat infringer policy would significantly benefit consumers, brands, legislators, and the platforms themselves</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/three-strikes-and-out-how-e-commerce-platforms-can-protect-consumers-from-repeat-offenders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read the full findings and policy recommendations &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Recognition of outcomes, not takedowns</h2>



<p><strong>“It’s important we’re not seen as ‘whack-a-mole’. It’s only whack-a-mole if you don’t apply data.”</strong></p>



<p><em>Gary Wengrofsky, Senior Director, Intellectual Property, Charter Communications speaking at the INSYNC Virtual Summit: November 2021</em></p>



<p>In 2021, the shift towards outcomes picked up pace. Many brand protection teams now set KPIs that focus on reducing the volume of infringement and cleaning up priority platforms, rather than the number of takedown notices sent.</p>



<p>With this approach, teams can free up resources for both targeted enforcement against high-risk infringements and to conduct in-depth data analysis and other value-adding activities. They can then deliver commercial value to the business and vastly increase return on investment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/brand-protection-kpis-how-to-focus-on-outcomes-not-takedowns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn how shifting the focus to outcomes delivers greater long-term value &gt;</a></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">A new brand protection maturity model</h2>



<p>With threats growing in both scale and variety, brand protection teams had a huge amount of ground to cover in 2021. From counterfeit goods and copycats, to fake NFTs and social media phishing scams, there are countless ways a company&#8217;s identity can be infringed and damaged online. The threats each business and industry faces vary, but there are general steps all organizations can take to evolve their approach.</p>



<p>As they mature, teams become an increasingly strategic asset — able not only to counter threats, but to identify new growth opportunities for the business.</p>



<p>In 2021, Incopro released an Online Brand Protection Maturity Report that outlines the four stages of this journey. From reactive teams that find themselves firefighting infringements, to effective teams that make use of advanced technology to tackle issues at scale, to progressive teams that champion wider applications of brand protection within their organizations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Brand Protection stretches beyond removing fake listings on marketplaces, impersonating posts on social media, and illegitimate website domains. You also need to pay attention to how your brand is presented legitimately across your key digital channels.</strong></p>



<p>Dormant or unmanaged assets on social media or domains often clog up online search results, causing consumers confusing&amp; diverting potential customers seeking to engage; if you neglect these assets you are effectively competing against yourself. Add online bad actors and your actual competitors to the mix and suddenly, retaining a strong brand identity and ensuring reliable online consumer experience becomes increasingly difficult.</p>



<p>This is why monitoring your digital footprint is key to your brand’s success online. In this piece, we walk you through the use cases, the outcomes you can deliver, and the methods for getting control of your digital footprint. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-is-your-digital-footprint">What is your digital footprint?</h2>



<p>Your digital footprint is your brand’s full online presence – ranging from social media accounts and individual pages on your company’s e-commerce website, to the product &amp; wider brand imagery you deploy online.</p>



<p>There is limited digital real estate – you are vying for a finite number of spots on the first page of search results. Without effective monitoring of your digital footprint, you run the risk that consumers are directed to outdated brand assets or exposed to defunct messaging that doesn’t align with current marketing campaigns.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-are-the-use-cases-for-monitoring-your-digital-footprint">What are the use cases for monitoring your digital footprint?</h2>



<p>The larger your business, the more agencies you engage, and the more territories that you operate in, the more brand assets, social accounts, and general ‘bloat’ associated with your brand is going to be visible online.</p>



<p>Here are two key use cases for monitoring digital footprint:</p>



<h3 id="h-1-rebranding-changing-brand-messaging-imagery-other-assets">1. Rebranding – changing brand messaging, imagery &amp; other assets</h3>



<p>With more ways than ever to promote products and services across the digital ecosystem and an increasing list of markets targeted, the volume of assets hosted across e-commerce websites, social channels, and by third-party sellers is always expanding.</p>



<p>Brand messaging will often change in response to evolving consumer behaviors or in order reach new consumers and markets. When engaging in a rebranding exercise or introducing new messaging / imagery, it is critical that you can identify and remedy old assets across your key digital channels.</p>



<h4 id="h-case-study-unilever">Case study: Unilever</h4>



<p>Leading FMCG company Unilever engaged in a rebranding exercise with one of its global beauty brands.</p>



<p>With Incopro’s technology, Unilever’s brand team was able to identify that nearly <strong>80%</strong> of the images that were still being broadcast online were from old marketing packs and no longer relevant to the brand.</p>



<p>This enabled Unilever’s team to isolate past digital assets content and remove it from websites, marketplaces, and social media platforms to prevent consumer confusion.</p>

</div>


<h3 id="h-2-social-media-audit-regaining-control-of-lost-active-or-dormant-accounts">2. Social media audit &#8211; regaining control of lost active or dormant accounts</h3>



<p>A Social Media Audit is the process of reviewing all&nbsp;social&nbsp;media entities associated with a brand&nbsp;(or brands)&nbsp;to&nbsp;create a managed inventory of active accounts to drive better consumer experience.</p>



<p>By monitoring your digital footprint, you can flag dormant or rogue social media accounts for removal and recover lost accounts and their followers.</p>



<h4 id="h-case-study-mondel-z-international">Case study: Mondelēz International</h4>



<p>Following a social media audit, global snacking company Mondelēz International used Incopro’s technology to identify social media accounts previously run by external agencies and internal regional teams that were no longer under central control of the company and posed a risk to brand reputation.</p>



<p>It was key that these accounts were either brought under central control or removed to protect their online consumer experience.</p>



<p>During this exercise, Mondelēz also used Incopro’s technology to identify all unofficial accounts that were trying to affiliate themselves with the company and lined them up for enforcement action.</p>


<div class="cta-button align-left">

</div>


<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-are-the-outcomes-of-cleaning-your-digital-footprint">What are the outcomes of cleaning your digital footprint?</h2>



<ul><li>Better use of digital spend, more effective marketing campaigns, and increased traffic to new products/website content</li><li>Aligned brand messaging across markets, preventing consumer confusion &amp; diversion, and increased consumer trust</li><li>More control of consumer experience across a known inventory of owned digital touchpoints</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-how-to-get-control-of-your-digital-footprint">How to get control of your digital footprint</h2>



<p>You’ve heard some of the use cases and the outcomes a successful strategy will deliver. Now time for the million-dollar question: “how do you monitor, clean &amp; get control of your digital footprint”?</p>



<p>A combination of a Brand Protection technology solution and subject matter&nbsp;expertise&nbsp;is needed to overcome issues&nbsp;flagged during your digital footprint audit.</p>



<p>Consumers take an omnichannel view to engaging with brands online so you need technology to present a holistic, analyzed view of your brand online across all digital channels. Added to this you need expertise in regaining control of your brand to focus on active authorized digital assets, and then isolate or remove outdated, or otherwise irrelevant assets that are detracting from your brand’s image.</p>



<p>With this approach, you can deliver a managed inventory of your online assets for better control of brand standards and consumer experience.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-identify-affected-digital-assets">1. Identify affected digital assets</h3>



<p>Using sophisticated keyword and image matching technology, you can scour all channels for accounts, social pages, web pages, and other assets that use your branding. This is a useful exercise to understand the extent of the problem and opportunity for control for Marketing and Brand Protection teams.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-regain-control-of-or-remove-assets">2. Regain control of or remove assets</h3>



<p>Combining this technology solution with the expertise from your Brand Protection Analyst team, you can regain full control of your wanted authorised assets, protecting followers and footfall. &nbsp;Wanted assets not currently under your brand’s direct control can be recovered, or if the assets are no longer required or are unauthorized, you can have these removed.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-talisman-enterprise-brand-protection-technology">Talisman – Enterprise Brand Protection technology</h2>



<p>Alongside sophisticated text, image &amp; logo matching technology, Talisman uses advanced capabilities including Network Analysis, to identify &amp; analyze all digital touchpoints whether owned or unauthorized. All of this takes place in a single platform from which all remediation and enforcement actions are delivered. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>New Incopro research reveals that 1 in 5 fake listings come from only 3% of illicit sellers.</strong> <strong>Up&nbsp;to $78bn in annual losses could be prevented if platforms proactively removed these repeat breachers.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.incoproip.com/insync-community-hub/three-strikes-and-out-how-e-commerce-platforms-can-protect-consumers-from-repeat-offenders/#download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incopro’s recent white paper</a> provides brands, e-commerce platforms and legislators with data on the proportion of repeat infringements undertaken by the same sellers, who use key global online marketplaces and social media platforms to infringe intellectual property.</p>



<p>The white paper also reports on the policies and procedures for repeat infringements currently employed by major online e-commerce platforms. </p>



<p>Finally, it presents detailed findings on the reduction in online counterfeiting and the commercial savings that could be secured if key e-commerce platforms combined:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>1. robust seller verification; and</strong></li><li><strong>2. a “three strikes and out” rule.</strong></li></ul>



<h3 id="h-what-is-a-repeat-breacher">What is a repeat breacher?</h3>



<p><strong>For the purpose of our study, we define repeat breachers as sellers that host multiple listings which infringe brand owners’ intellectual property (and/or repeatedly infringe platform policies).</strong></p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-e-commerce-platforms-and-repeat-breachers">E-commerce platforms and repeat breachers</h2>



<p>Forrester&nbsp;estimates that 82% of global B2C e-commerce growth over the past few years came from marketplaces [1]. Bad actors have been swift to exploit this growth, with the global economic value of counterfeiting and piracy potentially reaching $4.2 trillion USD by 2022 placing 5.4 million legitimate jobs at risk [2].</p>



<p>Incopro’s data shows that the&nbsp;proportion of&nbsp;sellers who&nbsp;repeatedly infringe rights and harm consumers&nbsp;typically&nbsp;comprises&nbsp;under <strong>3%</strong> of&nbsp;the total sellers enforced,&nbsp;but&nbsp;these&nbsp;sellers are responsible, on average, for over <strong>20%</strong> of the illicit issues detected and notified on the e-commerce operations considered in the study.</p>



<p>Draft legislation in both the US (such as the SHOP SAFE and SANTA Acts) and Europe (such as the Digital Services Act) contemplates requiring online e-commerce platforms to take steps to verify and authenticate sellers and promoters before they can use the platform. The legislation also considers requiring these platforms to implement policies to stop sellers who repeatedly infringe intellectual property. You can read a summary of the draft legislation <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/can-the-current-regulatory-landscape-tackle-growing-brand-misuse-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Our white paper focuses on providing evidence to inform the discussion on proposed legislative changes. The following is an example of what can occur in the absence of a seller verification and a three-strikes rule:</p>



<p><strong>In the course of 2020, a seller used the same e-commerce operation in Latin America to offer consumer goods for sale. In total, Breaches in respect of 9 different consumer brands were found by Incopro’s technology. On each occasion, Incopro’s technology notified the e-commerce operation of the Breach and the seller’s online identification. The e-commerce operation was asked to remove the offer for sale. Over the course of a year, 107 different Breaches were identified. On one day, 27 separate Breaches that each offered a fake or inferior product for sale were reported to the e-commerce operation.</strong></p>



<p>This bar chart&nbsp;below&nbsp;identifies the time period for the Breaches and notifications to the e-commerce operation.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top clear-bottom"><img width="689" height="505" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14324" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1.png 689w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-1-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /></figure>



<p>Although this e-commerce operation was notified about the same seller on 27 separate days &#8211; and with increasing frequency, this seller was not suspended. The seller was free to continue to use the platform to offer goods that might place consumers at risk.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-current-platform-policies">Current Platform Policies</h2>



<p>Platforms can protect both brands and consumers by effectively tackling repeat breachers. However, policies currently adopted by many platforms do not do enough to prevent repeat infringement.</p>



<p>Our findings indicate:</p>



<ul><li><strong>23</strong> <strong>out of the</strong> <strong>34</strong> platforms investigated have a policy against repeat breachers that is readily available to users &#8211; the remaining <strong>11</strong> have no relevant policy evident.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Out of the</strong> <strong>23</strong> platforms that have a policy directed at repeat breachers, only <strong>3</strong> have a policy which includes the 3-strike rule. These <strong>3</strong> platforms are based in the APAC region, and three serious offences on separate occasions result in account termination.</li></ul>



<p><strong>10 out of 23 </strong>platforms with a relevant policy have published definitions of the duration of account suspension. Again, amongst these <strong>10</strong> platforms only <strong>2</strong> have a policy that considers repeat offences sufficient ground for immediate termination.</p>



<p>It is noticeable that platforms like Aliexpress, which has a clear ‘three strikes’ rule and robust seller verification process, sees fewer repeat breaches than other platforms. Similarly, while Facebook and Instagram prefer not to disclose their policies publicly (to avoid gaming by bad actors), we are aware that they pay close attention to the issue of repeat breaches.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-new-methods-for-tackling-repeat-breachers">New methods for tackling repeat breachers</h2>



<h3 id="h-robust-seller-verification">Robust seller verification</h3>



<p>Platforms could require sellers to verify their identity before allowing them to advertise products for sale. This would serve to dissuade some bad actors from using these platforms, while also making enforcement and further action easier if they do go through the verification process. Seller verification is commonly achieved through credit card, bank statements or utility bills, or through government-issued identification cards.</p>



<p>Some platforms, such as Amazon and Alibaba, have already brought in forms of seller verification – although these policies could be strengthened. Others have yet to commit to seller verification, and consumers continue to be put at risk by anonymous seller accounts.</p>



<p><strong>Additional to robust seller verification, platforms should bring in a simple ‘three-strikes-and-out’ policy to tackle repeat infringement. Below, we have outlined two different thresholds that could be adopted.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-three-strikes-and-out-model-1-threshold-3-separate-days-of-enforcement">Three Strikes and Out Model 1: Threshold = 3 separate days of enforcement</h3>



<p>Platforms could adopt a policy where a seller is blocked from advertising further products for sale when a limit of 3 separate days of enforcement is reached.</p>



<h3 id="h-three-strikes-and-out-model-2-threshold-3-enforced-listings">Three Strikes and Out Model 2: Threshold = 3 enforced listings</h3>



<p>Alternatively, platforms could adopt a policy where a seller is blocked from advertising further listings when a limit of 3 enforced listings is reached. In the White Paper, this is modelled by grouping data based on the number of separate listings that have been enforced.</p>



<h3 id="h-three-strikes-in-action-japanese-marketplace">Three Strikes in action &#8211; Japanese marketplace</h3>



<p>A seller used an e-commerce platform in Japan and created <strong>2,063 </strong>separate listings under the same name for products copying the intellectual property of a fashion brand protected by Incopro. Incopro’s technology discovered these listings as they appeared over the course of the year. Each time listings were discovered, notices were sent to the e-commerce operation to remove the products. Notices were sent on <strong>42 </strong>separate days over the course of the year. Each time, the notified listings were removed by the platform, but the seller was able to continue listing offers on that platform.</p>



<p>If the seller had been stopped from using the marketplace after 3 listings were reported and removed, at least <strong>2,060 </strong>of the seller’s infringing listings would not have required enforcement (see figure 2 below).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large clear-top"><img width="751" height="551" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Figure-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14958" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Figure-2.png 751w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Figure-2-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /><figcaption><strong>Key</strong>:<br><strong>BLUE </strong>= listings enforced before the cut-off point had been reached.<br><strong>RED</strong> =&nbsp;listings enforced after the cut-off point had been reached.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="heading-branded">The impact of tackling repeat breachers</h2>



<p>Incopro’s analysis shows that:</p>



<ul><li>Only&nbsp;<strong>6%</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;sellers&nbsp;are&nbsp;repeatedly enforced on 3 days or more&nbsp;</li><li>However, these sellers are responsible for over <strong>24%</strong>&nbsp;of the listings Incopro has enforced against&nbsp;</li><li>The models show that&nbsp;a seller verification and repeat breacher policy would benefit consumers, brands, legislators, and the platforms themselves</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-1-commercial-savings">1. <strong>Commercial savings </strong></h3>



<p>Implementing either of these models could deliver reduce the availability of potentially harmful or low quality, non-genuine products to consumers by a minimum of <strong>11%</strong>&nbsp;(Model 1)&nbsp;or up to <strong>24%</strong>&nbsp;(Model 2). Given the losses suffered to online counterfeiting are estimated at over <strong>$320bn</strong> annually, this could equate to consumer savings of <strong>$35bn</strong> under Model 1 and up to <strong>$78bn</strong> under Model 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-protecting-consumers">2. Protecting consumers</h3>



<p>However, the benefit is not just financial. Non-genuine listings and counterfeits are often low-quality products, or those that may not meet regulatory standards, and are therefore highly likely to&nbsp;pose risks to consumer health and safety. </p>



<h3 id="h-3-platforms-benefit">3. Platforms benefit</h3>



<p>Additionally, given research suggests <strong>33%</strong> of consumers hold e-commerce operation responsible for addressing these issues, and <strong>64%</strong> of consumers have lost trust in a platform after unintentionally buying counterfeit products on that platform, addressing this issue effectively is also likely to drive the commercial success of e-commerce marketplaces [3].</p>

<p>Incopro&#8217;s analysis shows that a significant volume of counterfeiting and other brand misuse online could be stamped out if platforms implemented a strong verification process and one of the “three-strikes-and-out” policies put forward by Incopro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>More needs to be done to stop bad actors from misusing e-commerce platforms to infringe rights and harm consumers. With consumers increasingly using&nbsp;e-commerce platforms to buy products and secure services, it is critical for platforms and law makers to act.</strong></p>



<p>E-commerce platforms are essential to our everyday lives but are not properly regulated &#8211; in stark contrast to many other areas of the online ecosystem. In this blog, we explore the acceleration in e-commerce and look at the legislation that lawmakers are hoping will even the playing field against emboldened bad actors online.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">The Acceleration in E-Commerce and Risk of Consumer Harm</h2>



<p>Supercharged by the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce is the fastest growing retail segment in Europe and in North America[1]. According to Adobe’s Digital Economy Index (published February 2021), there was 42% year-over-year (YoY) e-commerce growth in 2020 [2]. In 2021, this acceleration in e-commerce is showing no little sign of slowing down, with 34% YoY growth between Jan and Feb 2021.</p>



<p>According to eMarketer, US based sales from ecommerce in 2020 were approximately $794.5 Bn USD, an increase of 32% year-on-year[3].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Significantly, this growth is being driven primarily by online marketplaces rather than e-commerce websites operated by traditional brick-and-mortar brands. Forrester&nbsp;estimates that 82% of global B2C e-commerce growth came from marketplaces – demonstrating the importance of effective consumer protection on these channels[4].</p>



<h3 id="h-brand-misuse-continues-to-grow-online">Brand Misuse Continues to Grow Online</h3>



<p>Bad actors have been swift to exploit e-commerce growth. It is estimated that the global economic value of counterfeiting and piracy could reach $4.2 trillion USD by 2022, placing 5.4 million legitimate jobs at risk[5].</p>



<p>Key figures:</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>The OECD estimates that trade in fake goods (as of March 2019) is <strong>3.3%</strong> of global trade and rising[6].&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>As of June 2020, EUIPO &amp; the OECD estimates that that the extent of counterfeit goods in global trade has reached as much as <strong>$509 billion</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>EUIPO &amp; the OECD the estimated direct and indirect sales losses attributable to counterfeiting in Europe amount to <strong>EUR 83</strong> billion each year.&nbsp;</li><li>The Global Brand Counterfeiting Report, 2018 estimates that the amount of counterfeiting globally had reached <strong>$1.2</strong> Trillion by 2019 and that the losses suffered from online counterfeiting amounted to <strong>$323</strong> Billion in 2017 [7].</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">A summary of the legislation under consideration in the US and EU</h2>



<p>Recognizing the growing risk of consumer harm and economic loss posed by brand misuse online, lawmakers in the US and EU have tabled potential legislation aimed at helping brand owners secure greater protection for their products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following legislation directly pertains to e-commerce platforms and enforcing greater seller transparency.</p>



<h3 id="h-us-legislation">US Legislation&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>SHOP SAFE&nbsp;Act&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Shop Safe Act was a bi-partisan Bill introduced on 2 March 2020 with the aim of “<em>creating accountability to prevent hazardous items from infiltrating the homes of millions of Americans</em>”[8].&nbsp;The Bill is not currently before Congress for consideration, but it is widely expected to be re-introduced in some form.&nbsp;Its key features included:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>a codified&nbsp;set of ‘best practices’&nbsp;on screening sellers&nbsp;and tackling&nbsp;repeat offenders in return for liability&nbsp;protection;&nbsp;</li><li>a focus on&nbsp;goods with a health and safety component (goods which may give rise to&nbsp;illness/disease/injury/serious adverse events/allergic reactions or death);&nbsp;</li><li>application to&nbsp;any&nbsp;E-commerce&nbsp;platform&nbsp;which&nbsp;sells&nbsp;to US consumers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Trademark Modernization Act (“the TMA”)</strong></p>



<p>The TMA was enacted into law on 27 December 2020 with the aim of strengthening and improving the accuracy and integrity of the federal trademark register. Its key features include:</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>improving US Trade Mark Office registry process and procedures including measures to improve consumer protection (including codification of a rebuttable presumption of irreparable harm in the event of a Court finding there has been an infringement given the consumer protection concerns which would arise otherwise).</li></ul>



<p><strong>INFORM Consumers Act&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The INFORM Consumer Act will require online marketplaces to collect and authenticate basic seller information which sellers must also provide to consumers. Its key features include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>requiring online retail marketplaces which include third-party sellers of consumer products to authenticate the identity of “high-volume third-party sellers” through disclosure of seller information, government IDs, tax registration details, business address,&nbsp;telephone&nbsp;and email, etc.</li></ul>



<p><strong>SANTA Act&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The SANTA Act is another consumer protection orientated, bipartisan initiative focussed on transparency.&nbsp;Its key features include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>requiring marketplaces to display a seller’s full name, business address, telephone number and working email&nbsp;address;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>a requirement to notify buyers if the product shipped is supplied by a seller other than the one detailed in the product listing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-eu-legislation"><strong>EU Legislation&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><strong>The Digital Services Act&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>The Digital Services Act (the “DSA”), published by the European Commission on 15 December 2020, represents potentially the most sweeping reform to regulation of the internet economy in Europe in close to two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the Act’s remit will be improving transparency rules first introduced within Article 5 of the EU E-Commerce Directive (“ECD”). Under current rules, bad actors can still mask their identity and keep key details of their illicit online operations hidden.</p>



<p>A “Know Your Business Customer” (“KYBC”) principle will therefore be introduced in the upcoming DSA package. Hosting providers will not be allowed to provide services to business users who provide identity information that is invalid or false.</p>



<p>If the legislation is enacted, platforms will find themselves having to do much more to protect brands and consumers – and may face financial penalties if they do not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DSA includes:</p>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>A requirement that larger E-commerce platforms verify seller information to establish the&nbsp;true identity&nbsp;of the seller.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul class="branded-bullet-list"><li>A requirement for platforms to suspend for “a reasonable period of time” (and after having issued&nbsp;a prior warning), the provision of their services to recipients that frequently (repeatedly) provide manifestly illegal content. No guidance is given on what amounts to a “reasonable period of time.”&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Platforms need to play their part</h2>



<p>While legislation has a critical role to play, it can be a blunt tool and may not immediately remedy the issue.</p>



<p>We are calling on e-commerce marketplaces to proactively work with brands, lawmakers, and companies such as Incopro to improve the policies and processes they employ to tackle bad actors exploiting their platforms.</p>



<p>Together, we can harness mechanisms such as intelligence sharing and working groups to provide better protections for brands and consumers online.</p>

<p>Roundtable participants noted that they are expecting budget cuts in 2021, with the impact likely to be particularly felt by luxury and retail brands.</p>



<p>There has also been a substantial loss of legally qualified personnel from Brand Protection teams, as they have been needed to fulfil other legal work given the rise in disputes and contract changes.</p>



<p>Businesses will therefore have to ‘do more with less’ and make efficient use of available resources. Making the right decision about where to invest limited resources is key – many businesses are looking to online monitoring and enforcement over the traditional offline model.</p>



<p>Above all else, Brand Protection teams should focus on engaging with key decision makers in the wider business to make the case for the importance of Brand Protection, it’s application beyond the legal function, and the need for increased budget.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-2-shifting-from-offline-to-online">2. Shifting from offline to online</h2>



<p>Offline investigations and test purchases have become increasingly difficult with the restrictions placed on offices. This issue is compounded by law enforcement and investigators not being available due to lockdowns and other regional restrictions.</p>



<p>In order for law enforcement to be involved, there are threshold limits to seize products and make an impact. Participants also noted that when raids are possible, they are ineffective without verifiable intelligence.</p>



<p>Bad actors have been quick to capitalize on the opportunity posed by consumers moving online. This has meant businesses have had to reconsider their Brand Protection strategy and shift focus from offline to online. Online monitoring and cleaning of key digital channels is now more critical than ever to safeguard legitimate sales.</p>



<p>On a strategic level, brands should a greater focus on their key e-commerce channels and set out clear goals (e.g. keeping Amazon free of fakes). Teams should also consider selective targeting on key channels based upon the selling content, as opposed to just going for the big sellers.</p>



<p>Brands should also look to prevent bad actors from using display adverts and services such as Adwords to divert consumers to their fake websites. <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Advanced keyword and image matching technology</a> is critical to achieving this.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-3-online-infringers-are-changing-behavior">3. Online infringers are changing behavior</h2>



<p>Participants agreed that there are now far more parties involved in brand misuse. Bad actors are now part of complex operations but often appear as isolated units, making enforcement more difficult.</p>



<p>It is critical, therefore, that brands are able to connect the dots between marketplaces, social media, e-commerce websites and other channels. Incopro’s <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/network-analysis/">Network Analysis technology</a> allows teams to uncover hidden online and offline connections between infringements to provide full visibility of the scale and complexity of the networks that undermine brands and harm consumers.</p>



<p>Bad actors are also becoming smarter at avoiding detection by Brand Protection teams while still remaining visible to consumers, using encrypted services such as WhatsApp and Telegram.</p>



<p>This is where the services of online investigators become extremely useful – they can embed themselves within groups on messaging apps to gather intelligence on the activity of bad actors, feeding this back to Brand Protection teams to take action.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-4-platforms-aren-t-playing-their-part">4. Platforms aren&#8217;t playing their part</h2>



<p>Participants stated that their teams are tracking any changes to legislation that pertains to platforms so that approved sellers &#8211; and not counterfeit sellers &#8211; are shown to users.</p>



<p>Some platforms have been slow to keep up with increasing volumes of infringement throughout the course of the pandemic, with delayed response times and terms of use not being strictly enforced.</p>



<p>However, there is still hope that platforms will take more proactive steps to protect consumers. Brands will have a key role to play and will need to be more open to sharing specific intelligence with platforms and other parties so that joint action can be taken and policies can be revised.</p>



<p>Participants also agreed that educational campaigns about counterfeiting issues and other forms of brand misuse, designed for consumers and business partners, are important and can be effective.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The recent suspensions of Trump’s social media profiles could have large ramifications for the Brand Protection community.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>While the US is no doubt experiencing tumultuous times, the banning of Donald Trump’s accounts has shown that large platforms can:</p>



<ul><li>1. Self-regulate, if there is incentive to do so</li><li>2. Ban users, completely and for life</li><li>3. Allow or not allow content (such as misinformation and fake news articles leading up to the election)</li></ul>



<p>It’s clear on both sides of the aisle that a question has been raised – how and why do platforms get to choose what content is allowed?</p>



<p>Now with greater scrutiny of the role of social media companies as ‘publishers’ rather than ‘platforms’, regulation of the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube is becoming increasingly likely.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Silicon Valley’s moves to eject President Trump from social media represent a display of power the companies have avoided making for nearly four years. Now Twitter Inc., Facebook Inc. and others must reckon with what comes next […] The actions against Mr. Trump and Parler illustrate more starkly than ever the companies’ influence over conversation online […]&#8221;</p><cite>The Washington Post (Jan 10, 2021) [1]</cite></blockquote>



<p>If the tech giants have the capability and willingness to ban Trump for inciting violence, why not counterfeit products? Why not illicit medicines sold through illegitimate channels? Why not items prohibited by the platforms’ own policies?</p>



<p>There is a clear shift in platforms’ policy, with the actions against Trump and Parler (an ‘alt-tech’ microblogging and social networking service) likely to push the US government to act on the significant influence these handful of companies have online. Incopro believes it is critical that legislative action extends to mandating penalties for facilitating the sales of dangerous/illegal products after receiving notice of infringement.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Platforms have shown that they are willing to monitor and action the content they host; now they need to do it in the name of consumer protection.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The Lanham Act</strong>,<strong> current legislation that governs the use of trademarks in the US, was first adopted in 1947 and is therefore ill-equipped to effectively protect brand owners as they promote their products using new technologies and platforms.</strong></p>



<p>The issue has been brought to the limelight by hashtag-related trademark abuse on social media, with platforms often reluctant to remove content on this basis.</p>



<p>Collaboration between platforms, law makers, and Brand Protection experts is critical to bring IP legislation in line with the rapidly moving online environment and to balance the many conflicting rights and interests.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-the-current-legal-environment">The current legal environment</h2>



<p>Observing that a majority of U.S based social media companies utilize hashtags, which may contain trademarks, it is necessary to delve into the <strong>Lanham Act </strong>[1] which regulates trademark related matters. A trademark is comprised of three cumulative different elements:</p>



<ul><li>A distinctive name, which may comprise of words, symbols, image or in some rare occasions, even scents and sounds;</li><li>That is used to identify the source of goods or services by distinguishing them from other parties;</li><li>And is used for commercial purposes.</li></ul>



<p>By registering a trademark, a party gains its exclusive use in the general commerce, being able to not only trade under it, but also license it and ward off any potential parties attempting to infringe it.</p>



<p>In practice, since the late 2000s, the use of the hashtag to cross-refer to a specific content or theme has been rising substantially on social media platforms as it allowed a significant reduction of marketing costs, strengthened consumers’ loyalty and easily attracted new ones. It is no surprise that such use was quickly seen as an efficient way to advertise and promote brands online [2]. This led to an increase of trademark applications for hashtags. One example would be the case of Coca Cola Company who had previously registered the trademark for “#cokecanpics” [3].</p>



<p>But is the use of the metadata tag &#8211; the hashtag keyword referring to a registered trademark in the present case &#8211; always lawful on social media?</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-trademark-infringement-through-hashtag-abuse">Trademark infringement through hashtag abuse</h2>



<p>If a hashtag includes a trademark that has been registered or suggests a connection with this trademark or the trademark owner in a way that is likely to misuse consumers, there may be a ground for trademark abuse [4]. In particular, an infringement seems to be established when the likelihood of confusion and association is linked to the advertisement of competing brands or goods and services that are very similar to the ones the registered trademark distinguishes [5].</p>



<p>Indeed, in the 2015 case <em>Fraternity Collection v Fargnoli</em>, a former employee of the plaintiff began utilizing hashtags such as “#FratCollection” and “#FraternityCollection” to advertise fashion designs belonging to the defendant. While the parties both moved to dismiss the case, the judge refused the dismissal and mention that ““hashtagging a competitor’s name or product in social media posts could, in certain circumstances, deceive consumers”[6].</p>



<p>Even though the case was eventually settled by the parties and dismissed subsequently, it highlights the following argument: using well-known trademarks or trademarks’ reputation and goodwill in hashtags in order to advertise one’s own goods and services to make profit via an increased traffic on their online content can be fraudulent and seen as unfair competition.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, social media platforms tend to be reluctant to remove content on the ground of “hashtag &#8211; related trademark abuse”. Indeed, the confusion as to the origin, connection or sponsorship of the goods and services can be tricky to establish. Platforms are most likely to find that the use of trademarks in hashtags identifies and comments on goods and services rather than constitutes a violation of intellectual property rights, following a reasoning that is similar to the one for <em>Eksouzian v. Albanese</em> [7]&nbsp; which holds that “hashtags are merely descriptive devices, not trademarks, unitary or otherwise, in and of themselves” which are “used to direct consumers to the location of the promotion”[8].</p>



<p>Moreover, it is worth mentioning that trademark owners will see their trademarks used as a hashtag on predominant social media platforms, even in posts unrelated to their products and that another limitation to trademark enforcement in that case is the notion of Fair Use. While not delving in detail into the notions of fair use, one fact is necessary to bring to the spotlight: If the use of the hashtag is of non-commercial use (i.e. a product review) then we would be in the presence of fair use.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-the-need-for-modernized-ip-legislation">The need for modernized IP legislation</h2>



<p>These trends on social media could suggest that hashtags, which have become essential social media instruments reflecting “a culture of sharing and openness, and “real-time” marketing” [9] are not compatible with the current intellectual property laws.</p>



<p>Trademark Law around hashtags undoubtedly remains until this day quite a grey area and further communication and exchanges between platforms, intellectual property law makers, lawyers and brand protection experts appear necessary to redefine the notion of trademark which is perpetually evolving in the digital era and to put in balance conflicting rights and interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>With expert insights from Caroline Thompson, Manager of the Trademark, Domain and Infringement Group at leading global educational testing and assessment organization</strong> <strong>ETS, we explore the emerging threats on social media.</strong></p>



<p>Alongside traditional risks posed on social media such as counterfeiting, brands face other forms of infringement such as false association and hashtag abuse. See the tools and best practices employed by ETS to prevent consumer confusion and brand dilution on social media — their key digital marketing channel.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-part-1-social-media-threats-facing-ets">Part 1: Social Media threats facing ETS</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Social Media platforms are unique, powerful tools. They enable organizations and third parties to both represent and misrepresent a brand to consumers worldwide.</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>For ETS, a strong social media presence is critical to accomplish their mission of advancing quality and equity in education for people worldwide through online learning, tests, and qualifications.</p>



<p>Most of their test takers are elementary school through university aged, a demographic that makes up nearly 75% of social media users across all platforms. As such, ETS’ target audience&nbsp;are typically frequent users of social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter,&nbsp;TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook and YouTube – giving the business an opportunity to organically engage with potential test takers worldwide.</p>



<p>However, counterfeiters also recognize that their target audience is on social media and use the same channels to try to drum up business. ETS’ main counterfeiting issue is fake test certificates and score reports sold to individuals. ETS&nbsp;tests have been developed through years of educational research and analyst &#8211; fake test results are therefore extremely damaging to their brand and fundamentally unfair to the students who put in the hard work to receive an authentic score.</p>



<p>Unlike phishing websites that are designed to look like ETS’ corporate website and trick consumers, counterfeit test certificates are sold to social media users that fully understand they are purchasing a fake. It is therefore unlikely that this type of consumer will be converted and take legitimate tests.</p>



<p>However, when ETS successfully prevents the access of these fake products through targeted enforcement, the business achieves its core goal of protecting well-intentioned consumers that take authentic tests and the equity of the brand.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-part-2-tackling-false-association-and-other-brand-misuse">Part 2: Tackling false association and other brand misuse</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Counterfeiting is far from being the only threat facing brand owners on social media. Businesses must keep one eye on how bad actors are using brand names in damaging ways.</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>If your business owns unique trademarks and brand names, Caroline states that it’s important to monitor how they’re being used&nbsp;within&nbsp;social media handles&nbsp;and posts&nbsp;&#8211; consumers often assume that use of the mark in a handle suggests affiliation or endorsement by the brand owner.</p>



<p>Two of ETS’ flagship brands, TOEFL and TOEIC tests, aren’t words in the English language. Therefore, if a social media user sees “TOEFL” in a post, they are likely to immediately link this to ETS &#8211; even if the content of the account is unrelated to the brand.</p>



<p>While ETS mainly take down social accounts for impersonation or selling counterfeit items, they also prioritize removal of accounts with their brands in the handle or within hashtags posted alongside unrelated content. Platforms are generally responsive in having this type of content removed.</p>



<p>Brand owners should get familiarized with the social media landscape and learn how bad actors are using brand names in ways that are damaging. By collecting this data, you can home in on search keywords to ensure you’re detecting the right data and quickly removing damaging brand name use.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-part-3-geotargeting-as-a-successful-strategy-to-defeat-bad-actors">Part 3: Geotargeting as a successful strategy to defeat bad actors</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Brands&nbsp;face threats from sales of unlicensed&nbsp;or suspicious&nbsp;goods on large marketplaces and websites around the globe. However, the ability to specifically target regions can prove extremely valuable.</strong><strong></strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“Our biggest win on social media has been geographic targeting.”&nbsp;</strong></p><cite>&#8211; Caroline Thompson, ETS</cite></blockquote>



<p>Prior to social media becoming a key touchpoint to consumers, ETS was aware of cheat activity in China on websites (different postings and materials that assist test takers in cheating on ETS exams). Due to their rigorous enforcement in that region, the number of websites offering cheat services in China declined.</p>



<p>ETS then began to see a spike on social media instead both in China and in Arabic speaking countries (mainly United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia). ETS have focused on removal of the content in these geographic regions and as a result the number of posts from these regions has dropped to nearly zero.</p>



<p>ETS acknowledge that the bad actors have likely moved to new platforms, but these platforms are more obscure and less frequented by consumers, therefore reducing exposure and risk.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“I highly recommend geographic targeting as part of your social media and enforcement strategy. When our business leads mention they have plans to enter a new market, it’s also super helpful for us to be able to run a report of both the infringement landscape in that reason and also our enforcement successes to date as a data point for them to base their business decisions on.”&nbsp;</strong></p><cite>&#8211; Caroline Thompson, ETS</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-part-4-ensuring-cross-functional-collaboration-and-communication-to-protect-legitimate-channels">Part 4: Ensuring cross-functional collaboration and communication to protect legitimate channels</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>It is critical that businesses can discern between authorized partners, and illegitimate third parties and communicate with the wider business to ensure effective enforcement.</strong></p>



<p>ETS has a complex distribution and sales network, with a&nbsp;database of test centers, affiliate entities, and subsidiaries. Caroline’s team routinely ask for updated spreadsheets from the departments in charge of managing the different networks and they also keep a running list of authorized and ETS owned social media accounts. This is to ensure they do not inadvertently remove authentic accounts and to provide transparency on enforcement activity.</p>



<p>Caroline advises that caution is always the best policy. If a page looks and feels legitimate, further research will be needed before submitting a complaint against it. She also encourages brand owners to maintain contact cheat sheets so they can alert the relevant Brand Protection team to infringement of a specific brand.</p>



<p>It is important to note that things are rarely easy when a relationship ends with a distributor. Caroline cautions that distributors will usually drag their heals before giving up their rights to logo use, brand name use, domain names, etc. Those that are responsible for social media takedowns need to be notified when a relationship ends, and a compliance check of social media accounts is needed as part of the off-boarding process.</p>



<h3 id="h-multiple-brands-and-business-teams-need-to-remain-committed-to-a-strategic-brand-protection-program">Multiple brands and business teams need to remain committed to a strategic Brand Protection program</h3>



<p>All marketing material and social media content that is shared by ETS goes through Caroline’s department to ensure correct trademark and logo use. This is also the case for any marketing materials or social media accounts that ETS’ affiliates, subsidiaries and test centers put out there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having specific&nbsp;color&nbsp;schemes, type font and logo use guidelines seems trivial, but a unified brand presence across a network will help consumers spot legitimate content from fraudsters imitations.&nbsp;If a business models good Brand Protection strategy and the correct use of trademarks at the corporate level, affiliates and distributors will follow suit. And if they don’t, Caroline notes you can gently lead them in that direction through internal review of their marketing materials. ETS also have a 15 page “How-to” guide for their test&nbsp;center&nbsp;and distribution networks on correct use of their trademarks and logos&nbsp;and they host training sessions with new distributors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swift reporting is also critical. Caroline’s team creates brand enforcement reports quarterly that show what her department has done to protect the brand globally including trademark oppositions, social media takedowns, mobile app takedowns, website takedowns, and UDRP and other domain recovery efforts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>“Social media enforcement alone is not the answer to proving how valuable enforcement is to your company… but it is a huge piece of the puzzle.”</strong></p><cite>&#8211; Caroline Thompson, ETS</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-talk-to-an-expert">Talk to an Expert&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>As social media usage continues its upward trajectory, businesses must take greater head of this key consumer touchpoint and move to protect their brand from opportunists and criminals.</strong><strong></strong></p>
