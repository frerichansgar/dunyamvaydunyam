<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>In good news for brand owners, 2020 holiday spending reached an eye watering $100 billion by December in the US alone [1]. However, e-commerce events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday continue to be targeted by copycats, impersonators and counterfeiters who exploit spikes in consumer demand.</strong></p>



<p>These sales figures should be understood as part of a trend; e-commerce growth continues at rapid pace, with brick-and-mortar footfall decimated by the ongoing effects of COVID-19. In 2020, e-commerce tore up previous predictions and grew by <strong>30%</strong> in the US[2]. This is a new high for online sales, and a level not previously predicted until 2022.</p>



<p>In this piece, we detail our findings on brand exploitation during Black Friday 2020 and illustrate why a comprehensive Brand Protection strategy is needed to ensure your business can succeed as the world rapidly shifts online.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Brand exploiter behavior during Black Friday</h2>



<p>Brand exploiters hide their fake products among genuine discounted goods and are therefore able to mask low pricing that would usually raise eyebrows. Even to the savviest of consumers, counterfeits become difficult to identify within a sea of constantly changing offers and flash-sales.</p>



<p>With <strong>55%</strong> of consumers begin their online shopping searches on Amazon’s site [3] – brand owners are immediately put at a disadvantage by brand exploiters operating on marketplaces during sale events.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Black Friday 2020: Rampant brand exploitation on large e-commerce platforms</h2>



<p>The holidays are a particularly prolific time for brand exploiters. With 2020&#8217;s record-high online shopping volumes, counterfeit listings and sales are spiking. For example, in the week of Thanksgiving / run up to Black Friday / Cyber Monday 2020, compared to a week 3 months back, Incopro’s technology detected:</p>



<ul><li><strong>443%</strong> growth of high-risk listings on Amazon for a consumer electronics brand</li><li><strong>155%</strong> growth of high-risk listings on eBay for a watch/jewelry retailer</li><li><strong>121%</strong> increase in high-risk listings on Amazon for a luxury brand</li><li><strong>51%</strong> increase in high-risk listings on Amazon for a streetwear brand</li></ul>



<h3>Percentage growth of infringement on Amazon &amp; eBay in the run up to December</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>19th-26th August</td><td>19th-26th November</td><td>Growth</td><td>Platform</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer electronics</td><td>228</td><td>1239</td><td>443%</td><td>Amazon</td></tr><tr><td>Watch brand</td><td>442</td><td>1125</td><td>155%</td><td>Ebay</td></tr><tr><td>Luxury brand</td><td>206</td><td>455</td><td>121%</td><td>Amazon</td></tr><tr><td>Streetwear brand</td><td>360</td><td>543</td><td>51%</td><td>Amazon</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Why platforms need to do more</h2>



<p>Many platforms have measures in place to facilitate the removal of brand exploiters. However, these tools offer varied results and do not provide enough coverage to make a lasting impact.</p>



<h3 id="h-amazon-brand-registry-not-providing-peace-of-mind-to-brands">Amazon – Brand Registry not providing peace of mind to brands</h3>



<p>The platform’s Brand Protection program “Brand Registry” is characterized by slow and inadequate responses to brand exploitation. Inconsistencies in the processing time for similar or identical violations also create a headache for brand owners. This means cases often need to be escalated – this additional step is burdensome and far more inconsistent than the initial reporting process.<br><br>Furthermore, Amazon often prevents brand owners from reporting violations if the rate of successful enforcement is deemed too low, and subsequently demand that a test purchase is conducted as evidence.</p>



<h3 id="h-ebay-inconsistent-responses-to-enforcement-and-declining-compliance">eBay – Inconsistent responses to enforcement and declining compliance</h3>



<p>eBay too suffers from inconsistent and slow responses to enforcement. It has also recently shown a decline in overall compliance. Practices towards similar or identical reported listings vary enormously across territories. And to add further frustration, explanations for notice rejections are frequently inconsistent, incorrect, or missing altogether, requiring multiple follow-ups.</p>



<p>Such issues extend to notices regarding breaches of the platform’s own policy, which covers soon-to-expire and expired products or products missing expiry dates, particularly in relation to medication, foodstuffs, and other consumable goods.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-what-can-brands-do">What can brands do?</h2>



<p>It is essential that brands monitor brand exploitation trends in the run-up to Black Friday. For each high-priority platform, you should have a comprehensive strategy in place. Our proposed strategy for Amazon during the holiday season is as follows:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Monitor the buy box on your listings closely (up to 82% of all Amazon sales go through the buy box [4])</li><li>Proactively defend your brand on Amazon by signing up to Brand Registry and ‘gate’ high-priority ASINs (the ASIN is the unique offer identifier on Amazon &#8211; it poses difficulty to brand owners because Amazon requires all listings for a single product to be located on the same ASIN page)</li><li>Monitor non-gated authorized ASINs and look for duplicates</li></ol>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Amazon’s Brand Registry</strong>&nbsp;offers tools to help brands manage their presence on the marketplace and to remove infringing products, including:</p>



<ul><li>Bulk enforcement of counterfeit ASINs</li><li>Merging duplicate ASINs</li></ul>



<p><strong><br>ASIN gating</strong>&nbsp;refers to the practice of ‘locking’ authorized ASINs so that only a select list of verified sellers can operate on it. Brands should be aware that it is only available to those enrolled in the Brand Registry. It is a paid service and is reserved for a select number of your listings.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-comprehensive-year-round-strategy">A comprehensive year-round strategy</h3>



<p>Earlier, we mentioned that growth in e-commerce is not isolated to sales event but is part of a long-term trend that has been accelerated by COVID-19. In a post-pandemic world, you’ll need a comprehensive strategy that protects your consumers and revenue streams online.</p>



<p>Noting the limitations of platforms tools, collaboration with platforms is still core to building this strategy. Where&nbsp;your consumers shop and&nbsp;who&nbsp;they purchase from are important considerations when choosing the platforms that you prioritize and develop robust relationships with.</p>



<p>Once you’ve decided the key platforms in which to focus your efforts, you should seek to engage with them directly or through a trusted partner. The following approach should be considered as part of your relationship building exercise:</p>



<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts within the platforms’ support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;</li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;</li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;and interact with the relevant representatives where the platform has local websites</li></ul>



<p>As alluded to, there is only so much you can achieve without a technology solution. A critical component of a comprehensive strategy is sophisticated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectiontechnology">Brand Protection technology</a>&nbsp;that works in tandem with platform tools but also:</p>



<ul><li>Collects more data on the individuals exploiting your brand</li><li>Prioritizes high-risk listings that your consumers are most likely to find</li><li>Makes the connection between brand exploiters operating across multiple channels and regions</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Brand Protection technology is critical</h2>



<p>Talisman, Incopro’s Brand Protection platform, is a complete tool that ensures that businesses have all the data they need related to brand exploitation, including the risk posed by infringing listings and a view of the networks of criminals targeting their brands. Once gathered, Talisman provides the means for seamless enforcement against brand exploiters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Counterfeiters and other online bad actors are opportunistic at their core and will seize on any chance to make a quick profit out of unsuspecting consumers. The COVID-19 crisis is no different, with bad actors swift to list both medical products and everyday consumer items at marked-up prices as demand skyrockets.</strong></p>



<p>Price gouging refers to the act of exploiting consumers during an external crisis by charging excessive prices for products far above the market rate. During the COVID-19 crisis, price gouging has been observed on B2C marketplaces and websites by distributors and private sellers. Many countries have anti-price gouging legislation to protect consumers during national emergencies, but even where protections do not exist platforms will often prohibit the practice.</p>



<p>In April, Amazon claimed it had removed more than half a million COVID-related items and suspended more than 6,000 sellers across its global marketplaces after infringing its price gouging rules[1].</p>



<p>In an unusual step, Amazon has even gone as far as requesting new legislation to be drafted with VP of Public Policy Brian Huseman calling on Congress to make price gouging illegal during a national crisis[2]. The executive notes that similar laws already exist at state level and are effective at fighting bad actors online.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 crisis has seen a dramatic increase in price gouging on a wide range of products, including those that consumers are more reliant on than ever: pharmaceuticals, hygiene products, and medical equipment. This piece looks at the data, providing analysis of the scale of the issue, before sharing insights into how your business can tackle this growing threat effectively.</p>



<h3>Price gouging pharmaceuticals: Exploiting vulnerable consumers</h3>



<p>COVID-19 related price gouging was first identified on marketplace listings for pharmaceuticals and other medical equipment supplies. Globally, enforcement agencies and regional authorities are looking to demonstrate their vigilance to the public in this climate and are watching for price hikes.</p>

<p>Talisman, Incopro’s Brand Protection platform, has identified rampant price gouging in recent weeks &#8211; which were then acted on by our analysts. These are just two of the countless infringing listings discovered:</p>



<ul><li>Price gouging of up to a staggering <strong>750%</strong> for a well-known painkiller with a box of 24 capsules on eBay for <strong>$329</strong> with no guarantee they are authentic.</li><li>Price gouging of up to <strong>100%</strong> for a global cold &amp; flu brand across key marketplaces around the world.</li></ul>



<p>Price gougers are exploiting vulnerable consumers who feel that they have little choice but to pay the hugely inflated prices for essential medical drugs and supplies.</p>



<h3><strong>Price gouging on consumer goods: Taking advantage of spikes in demand</strong></h3>



<p>The issue is not isolated to the health sector; we have also observed an increase in price gouging across a wide range of other product categories. Incopro’s Brand Protection experts harnessed Talisman to monitor these product categories on Amazon US for price gouging:</p>



<h4>Desks and computer monitors</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>desks</strong> and <strong>computer monitors</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings on average by <strong>193%</strong> since COIVD-19 hit. An example can be seen below, showing the increase in price listed by a third-party seller for a desk from the beginning of the year to now, clearly taking advantage of the crisis.</p>



<p>One listing for a simple home-working desk saw a large price increase of <strong>247%</strong>, going from <strong>$89</strong> to <strong>$220</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1000" height="476" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020.jpg" alt="Price fluctuations on home office furniture sold on Amazon.com (May 2020)" class="wp-image-8072" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020.jpg 1000w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Price-fluctuations-on-home-office-furniture-sold-on-Amazon-May-2020-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption>Price fluctuations on home office furniture sold on Amazon.com (May 2020)</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Sports and exercise equipment</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>bench presses</strong> and <strong>yoga mats</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings by <strong>168%</strong> on average since COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>One listing saw a large price increase of <strong>370%</strong>, going from <strong>$160</strong> to <strong>$330</strong>. This screenshot of a customer review from March 2020 shows that the product listed was cheap and potentially harmful, yet concedes that there’s ‘slim pickings’ due to the pandemic’s effect on supply:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1378" height="345" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020.png" alt="Amazon customer review for bench press (March 2020)" class="wp-image-8074" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020.png 1378w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-300x75.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-1024x256.png 1024w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amazon.com-customer-review-for-bench-press-March-2020-768x192.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1378px) 100vw, 1378px" /><figcaption>Amazon customer review for bench press (March 2020)</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Home entertainment</h4>



<p>We analyzed the 10 most visible listings for <strong>a leading games console</strong>, discovering that sellers have increased prices of their listings by <strong>161%</strong> since COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>This data shows that sellers are taking advantage of COVID-19 to increase the prices of their listings, with all categories showing sellers increasing their prices by over <strong>150%</strong> since the crisis has hit.</p>



<h3>The threat to consumer safety and brand reputation</h3>



<p>Not only do consumers face the prospect of massively overpaying for a product, there is also a chance that the products they are purchasing are already used[3] – meaning consumers are not getting what they paid for, or even non-genuine – putting consumers at risk of physical harm.</p>



<p>Brands face a two-fold issue with price gouging:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Policing distributors that are selling genuine product far above the market rate/agreed price</li><li>Removing copycat/counterfeit products that use the brand’s IP and are sold far above the market rate</li></ol>



<p>Price gouging damages brand reputation and consumer trust in a brand, regardless if the product on offer is genuine. Distributors of the products will not face the brunt of your reputational damage, even if they are the party engaging in price gouging. Any damage is likely to be long-term and extremely difficult to repair.</p>



<p>In April, Incopro polled 87 business decision makers and Brand Protection professionals, asking about what they perceived to be the biggest risk to their businesses due to COVID-19 – over&nbsp;<strong>45%</strong>&nbsp;said the risk to consumer trust and the consumer-to-brand relationship. This highlights that they recognize the risk that the shift in market dynamic has created.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded">Platforms cannot tackle the threat alone</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve noted that some platforms are taking action, and governments are setting up dedicated &#8216;price gouging&#8217; taskforces &#8211; but they are unable to stem the tide alone. Amazon, for example, will actively monitor for price gouging, but due to the scale of the problem and the limits of their technology may be slow to identity and remove infringements. However, if they are notified by a brand of specific instances of price gouging, they will be able to act far swifter.</p>



<p>Incopro’s Brand Protection technology and expert analysts give you cross-platform, cross-territory insights into price gouging with a tried and tested online enforcement solution delivered at scale directly from the platform. The platform can also collate evidence packs for injunctions and wider monetary relief. and bespoke reporting by brand, platform, territory provides internal stakeholders with valuable sales insights.</p>



<p>Price gouging is not a new phenomenon – it existed before COVID-19 and will continue even as the global crisis eventually subsides. By taking a strong stance now, you can put consumer safety at the heart of your Brand Protection strategy.</p>

<h2>According to new Incopro research, up to <strong>3 in 9</strong> first-page search results for branded baby teethers are for websites selling harmful or counterfeit products, posing danger to young children.</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Childrens-products_3-in-9-search-results-harmful_positive_RGB1.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>As total toy sales have slumped in the wake of the demise of US retail giant Toys “R” Us, ecommerce sales have been on the rise, representing a tectonic shift in the toy landscape.</p>



<p>Consumers now purchase toys from a wide array of relatively unknown online retailers, instead of trusted and well-established offline stores. They also purchase from marketplaces such as Amazon which, despite being widely regarded by consumers as a trustworthy platform, is known to contain thousands of counterfeit products.</p>



<p>Worryingly, consumers are increasingly being exposed to counterfeit toys and baby products on search engines in the run-up to seasonal events such as Black Friday and Christmas. Poorly-constructed fakes such as baby teethers have even been found to be available on popular marketplaces, putting young children at risk of choking.</p>



<p>A Senate Finance Committee staff report published on November 7 calls for U.S Customs and Border Protection to be able to share more information on counterfeits with private sector firms such as ecommerce platforms, but search engines themselves have a greater role to play in fighting online counterfeiting.</p>



<h3>The dangers of fake children’s products</h3>



<p>Toy brands abide by stringent regulation on materials and methods of manufacturing – and adhere to stricter regulation still for baby products. All items sold must also include detailed warnings and instructions to ensure their proper use.</p>



<p>Counterfeiters, on the other hand, care little about child safety and produce toys in unsanitary and unregulated environments, using poor-quality or even toxic parts.</p>



<p>Last December, it was reported that a 4-year-old child in the US was rushed to hospital after swallowing 13 tiny magnets exposed when a counterfeit toy broke apart <sup>[1]</sup>. The internal infection that spread as a result meant the child had to have parts of their colon and intestines removed, leaving them permanently scarred.</p>



<p>News publications initially identified the toy as ‘Magformers’, a magnetic construction set sold by a US firm. According to Inc.com, it was only after further investigation that it was revealed the product was a counterfeit produced by a Chinese company and, disturbingly, was widely available on marketplaces.</p>



<h3>Notorious online marketplaces found in search results</h3>



<p>Fake children’s products such as baby teethers are appearing at the top of search results and are readily available to consumers.</p>



<p>Incopro&#8217;s research reveals that searches for teethers contain a number of online marketplace listings – many of which offer fake or unsafe products. Of the first 10 results that would be displayed to a consumer, 32.5% directed to online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and ‘DHGate’. Of these, 65.4% appeared within the first five results on the page.</p>



<p>The chart below shows research on the volume of traffic that is directed via search engines to some of the largest global marketplaces that are gripped by counterfeiting.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Percentage-of-marketplace-traffic-from-organic-search_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>More than 50% of the traffic going to the notorious marketplaces ‘Prom’ (based in Ukraine), ‘Made-in-China’ and ‘DHGate’ (both based in China) is through organic search.</p></blockquote>



<p>Consumers finding and purchasing low-priced fakes on marketplaces outside of their home country is alarming. Many of these results are displayed when consumers search for branded toys and are designed to deceive them into thinking they are genuine.</p>



<h3>Searches for wholesale Comotomo teethers contain counterfeits</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image no-styling"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Wholesale-Comotomo-teether_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>A keyword search on Google.com for “wholesale comotomo teether” presented nine organic search results, each of which directed to a marketplace or ecommerce site. Of the nine organic search results, three were for potentially harmful products that misused the Comotomo trademark (highlighted in red).<br><br><em>Screenshot: A keyword search on Google.com for “wholesale comotomo teether” (Incopro, 2019). Note: The first result is a paid advertisement</em></p>



<p>The second organic result is a link to a category page on Alibaba and not a specific product, making it more challenging to get the marketplace to take action.</p>



<p>The presence of the brand name confuses the consumer &#8211; the page lists products that are the same or similar to the Comotomo products but are sold at a fraction of the price and are potentially harmful.</p>



<p>The search result also uses metadata supplied by Alibaba as seen below. The impression given to the consumer is that they will be landing on a page with 150 Comotomo products &#8211; this is not the case.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba-category-metadata-Comotomo-Baby-Suppliers_RGB.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p><em>Screenshot: Metadata on Alibaba category page for ‘Comotomo Baby Suppliers’ (Incopro, 2019). </em></p>



<p>Below the Alibaba search result is an example of another type of wholesale supplier. ‘ywhgifts.com’ sells a wide variety of counterfeits, from teething toys to baby applicators and cell phone cases. This site continues to receive a huge share of traffic from organic search (76.89% over the past year) despite its status.</p>



<p>Brand names for these products are prominently displayed in these results, leading to confusion that these products are produced by Comotomo when several are not.</p>



<h2>Search engines must do more</h2>



<p>Brands can demand fake products be taken down from marketplaces, but this is of little practical use &#8211; it would not deal with the results pages hosted on these sites that are deceiving consumers.</p>



<p>Search engines, instead, need to get ahead of the game and provide a technology-based solution to tackle counterfeits. In doing so, they can demonstrate their willingness to proactively engage in wider anti-counterfeiting efforts alongside the government and ecommerce platforms and protect children from serious harm.</p>



<p>If they sit back and refuse, case law that extends liability to search engines for harmful counterfeits may come calling.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size" id="h-singles-day-is-the-world-s-largest-ecommerce-festival-and-is-heavily-targeted-by-opportunistic-counterfeiters-posing-a-risk-to-consumers-and-brands"><strong>Singles’ Day is the world’s largest ecommerce festival and is heavily targeted by opportunistic counterfeiters, posing a risk to consumers and brands.</strong></p>



<p>Singles’ Day is the Chinese retail and ecommerce phenomenon that has skyrocketed in popularity over the last six years, outpacing similar sale events that are hosted throughout the globe. The scale of the event is huge; combined, Black Friday and Cyber Monday only achieved half as many sales by comparison in 2018 [1] [2], while Amazon only generated a comparatively minor $7.16bn [3] in sales during its ‘Prime Day’ in 2019.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-singles-day">What is Singles’ Day?</h3>



<p>Taking place on November 11, Singles’ Day was first conceived as an ‘anti-Valentine’s Day’ celebration by Chinese students in 1993. The holiday rose to prominence in 2009 when Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba encouraged brands and third-party sellers using its platforms to offer large discounts on everyday consumer goods for a 24-hour period, in the same vein as the then-emerging ‘Black Friday’. Alibaba signaled its ambitious intentions for the holiday by trademarking the term ‘shuangshiyi’ (double eleven) in 2012 to represent the date ‘11/11’.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="880" height="650" src="https://mk0incoprorqrlirgki5.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba_Sales_Graph_v2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-915" srcset="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba_Sales_Graph_v2.png 880w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba_Sales_Graph_v2-300x222.png 300w, https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alibaba_Sales_Graph_v2-768x567.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption><em>GMV for Alibaba ecommerce sales on Singles’ Day (Statista, 2019)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fast forward to 2017, and the event began to see offline expansion. Alibaba set up 60 pop-up stores across China and collaborated with retailers to launch 100,000 smart shops. A shopping mall in Hangzhou, China, was even opened in April 2018 in response to concerns that the Chinese ecommerce market was beginning to plateau.</p>



<p>With a third of the Chinese population purchasing items during Singles’ Day alone, Alibaba is expected to generate an eye-watering US$37bn in gross merchandising value from the event.</p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p>This year will see the expansion of available products to combat the knock-on effects from the ongoing US-China trade war. New product categories include cars and travel, with packages to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and discounted tickets for Disney’s theme park in Shanghai available.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p>China continues to be one of the world’s largest counterfeiting hotspots; over 40% of goods sold online in China are fakes or of poor quality, according to a state media report released in early 2019 [4].</p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p>International brands accounted for over 40% of total purchases during Singles’ Day 2018, demonstrating their appeal to the Chinese market. Indeed this trend increases to grow; 60% of Chinese consumers intend to purchase imported products this Singles’ Day [5].</p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p>Worryingly for brand owners, America’s trade war with China is likely to increase the size of the counterfeit market in both China and the US by making imported genuine products more expensive and stretching the resources already deployed towards fighting illicit trade [6].</p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p>As Singles’ Day expands into developing countries in Southeast Asia following Alibaba’s acquisition of marketplace ‘Lazada’, the threat of counterfeiting to brands is increasing.</p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<h4 id="h-opportunistic-counterfeiters-exploit-seasonal-demand">Opportunistic counterfeiters exploit seasonal demand</h4>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Incopro brand advisor Tosshan Ramgolam states: “Listings taking part in Singles’ Day promotions feature banner images next to the price. Talisman, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/products/talisman-online-brand-protection">Incopro’s brand protection tool</a>, collects the text in these banners and uses that as an indicator for risk to monitor counterfeiting activity for brands”.</p></blockquote>



<h3 id="h-other-marketplaces-also-facing-counterfeiting-threats">Other marketplaces also facing counterfeiting threats</h3>



<p>Other platforms such as Pinduoduo, a ‘group-buying’ platform, take part in the event. The platform is used alongside immensely popular WeChat (China’s equivalent of WhatsApp) for social shopping, and now boasts over 483.2 million users, representing growth of over 42% since 2018 [7].</p>



<p>The platform is frequented by wholesale buyers who purchase in bulk to sell products to consumers through other ecommerce channels across the globe.</p>



<p>Counterfeiters attempt to entice both price-sensitive buyers and those that intentionally purchase fakes on Pinduoduo, and there are fewer intermediaries within the supply chain to scrutinize product authenticity. As a result, the platform has received numerous complaints of very low product quality and fake products and was added to the US government’s counterfeit ‘blacklist’ in April 2019.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-can-brands-do">What can brands do?</h3>



<p>Whilst there is clear progress being made by marketplaces, social media platforms, and the Chinese government to combat IP infringement, brands need to be proactive.</p>



<p>A truly <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectionstrategy">comprehensive brand protection strategy</a> is essential and must combine a sophisticated technology solution, platform anti-counterfeiting tools, a well-maintained IP portfolio, and effective enforcement using local IP laws.</p>



<h4 id="h-register-your-intellectual-property-internationally">Register your intellectual property internationally</h4>



<p>It is crucial to register your IP to comply with the law in each territory where you believe your products will be in demand, regardless of whether you plan to sell there. Infringers will exploit any gaps in your IP portfolio to frustrate the enforcement process.</p>



<h4 id="h-develop-relationships-with-marketplaces-and-platforms">Develop relationships with marketplaces and platforms</h4>



<p>Brands should develop strong collaborative relationships with platforms, particularly in regions where your product is highly targeted. Many marketplaces such as Alibaba, Tmall and WeChat run brand protection schemes that aim to expedite the enforcement process.</p>



<h4 id="h-employ-intelligence-led-brand-protection-techniques">Employ intelligence-led brand protection techniques</h4>



<p>Brands shouldn’t rely on platforms alone to detect and remove infringements. Instead, they should invest in brand protection technology that can identify entire networks of infringers rather than individual accounts or listings. With this strategic approach, they can discover large-scale illicit networks, send notices against all entities, or utilize intelligence for offline action.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-online-brand-protection-key-to-reducing-infringement">Online Brand Protection key to reducing infringement</h2>



<p>Brands must be prepared to face threats online from opportunistic infringers that exploit increased demand; it is critical to factor in holidays, sales and other events throughout the year into your brand protection strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>When Google is told that it is indexing and returning search results for a webpage or website that is selling counterfeit products, it will take no action.</h2>
<p>Google’s refusal to act is putting consumers at risk; as an example, products such as counterfeit brake pads, fake antibiotics, and imitation baby teethers can all lead to potentially deadly consequences when used. Significant harm is also dealt to the companies targeted, who invest time and significant financial resource to create and market their brands.</p>
<p>Currently, Google will not de-index a specific page or website that offers counterfeits.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter" style="font-size: 14px;" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Google-logo_RGB_V2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Lack of action putting consumers at risk across the globe</h3>
<p>Recent research on search engine responsibility reveals that up to 60% of results returned offer consumers access to counterfeit and possibly dangerous goods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pharma_6-in-10-search-results-unlawful_-positive_RGB_V2-1024x394.png" alt="" width="450" height="173"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">In pharmaceuticals, six in 10 of Google’s first-page results following searches for the antibiotic Bactrim were for sites very likely to be operating unlawfully;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">In the children’s products category, a third of search results for a “Comotomo teether” featured potentially harmful products that misuse the Comotomo trademark;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">In the white goods sector, a search for refrigerator filters repeatedly directed consumers towards a website selling counterfeit goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>These sites, often dedicated to selling knock off products, don’t just infringe IP but are also potentially deadly &#8211; fake pharmaceuticals, car airbags, and fake cycle helmets are all widely available and put consumers at extreme risk.</p>
<p>The scale of this issue is enormous.</p>
<p>In this newly released White Paper, the findings demonstrate that in one month alone and for a single sample product in certain categories of consumer products, there were over 1,000 websites indexed by Google that sell infringing products to consumers.</p>
<p>If Google did remove these websites from their index these sites would be starved of oxygen and would fail, and there are case studies that prove so.&nbsp; The people who operate infringing websites don’t typically pay for advertising. Instead, they often rely on organic search, knowing that they will be found when consumers use search engines to look for brands or products.</p>
<h3>Google’s at odds with its own practices</h3>
<p>Google’s refusal is out of step with its own practices when dealing with other types of intellectual property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google will remove a URL from its search index when it is told that the page infringes copyright. Google removes millions of URLs on this basis.</li>
<li>However, Google won’t act when it is told that a URL is selling counterfeits – where trademark rights are infringed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This inconsistent approach stems from a difference in treatment for copyright and trademarks in the US.</p>
<p>Google acts against copyright infringement because it is legally required to do so under US law; the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requires Google to remove copyright infringing pages from its index when notified.</p>
<p>There is no similar legislation in the US that requires tech platforms to act on trademark infringement and so Google does nothing.</p>
<p>Other tech platforms, however, do act when they are told about the sale of counterfeit products on their platforms because they fear that they will be held to be “publishers” if they do nothing.</p>
<p>Google takes the view that it cannot be a “publisher” and only takes the minimum action required to remain legally compliant.</p>
<h3>Other platform responses highlight a stark contrast</h3>
<p>Incopro’s technology searches across the internet for intellectual property infringement. Working on behalf of over 600 brands, we detect millions of instances of infringement taking place online every day.</p>
<p>When Incopro notifies big tech companies such as Facebook or eBay of counterfeits being sold through these sites, they will act by removing the offer for sale from their platform.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, however, when Incopro asks Google to take these infringements out of their index, the tech giant routinely turns down these requests.</p>
<p>The resulting enforcement gap creates enormous difficulty for brand owners looking to protect their rights and presents a real risk to their revenues. This gap is particularly apparent when websites or even entire networks dedicated to counterfeiting are identified.</p>
<h3>Google can and should be challenged</h3>
<p>From a moral and cultural perspective, there is a compelling case that Google should do more when it knows that it’s displaying search results for counterfeits – products such as <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/blog/the-escalating-pharmaceutical-counterfeit-problem">fake anti-malarials</a> will put consumer&#8217;s health at serious risk, for example.</p>
<p>But there is also a growing legal case.</p>
<p>First, there is now a clear and developed line of legal authority that empowers the courts to require Google to act. The legal cases on this have been developed in several key jurisdictions and they are examined in detail by the law firms who have contributed opinions for this White Paper.</p>
<p>Google should cooperate with trademark owners and develop a streamlined and scaled approach to support court orders that enable Google to act with the protection of the courts. Instead, Google takes a combative stance, insisting on fighting any attempt to require it to do anything in this area.</p>
<p>Second, if Google continues to refuse to cooperate then it may be found to be liable for refusing to act when it is told about infringements that it indexes.</p>
<h3>What can brands do?</h3>
<p>So what are brands to do? Google’s position is that brands must obtain a court order against the sites themselves. Only then will they act. The reason being that the site must be declared illegal before they will move.</p>
<p>But if the same infringing site is featured in a Facebook or Instagram promotion, these platforms will respond and remove without requiring a court order. If it’s clear to other large tech platforms that there is clear infringement of trademark taking place, why is the same evidence regarded by Google as inadequate?</p>
<p>Google and other search engines are at the center of this. They should provide a scalable means to tackle this vast problem, or case law may come calling.</p>
<h2>It’s time for Google to change its approach</h2>
<p>Incopro is calling for search engines to work more closely with rights owners and their representatives to remove counterfeiters from the results they present to consumers.</p>
<p>This White Paper aims to provoke discussion amongst lawmakers, brands, platforms and other interested parties about how to establish a framework under which search engines take on a greater role in tackling consumer harm online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>With online counterfeiting on the rise, platforms and governments are beginning to take forward looking, if not always effective, steps to protect brands and consumers. However, brands should take ultimate responsibility to ensure that the volume of infringement is meaningfully reduced.</h2>
<p>Efforts by marketplaces to curtail infringement, such as Amazon Project Zero and eBay VeRO, have had <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/blog/six-key-limitations-of-amazon-project-zero">mixed results</a> but have succeeded in driving some counterfeiters away from the platforms. However, these bad actors have not been dissuaded from counterfeiting, merely pivoting where they conduct their illicit activities.</p>
<h3>A cautious platform response to counterfeits</h3>
<p>The Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is the unique offer identifier on Amazon and has been heavily exploited by counterfeiters. Amazon’s Project Zero offers a ‘self-service’ counterfeit removal tool, automated protections and product serialization. VeRO, eBay’s Verified Rights Owner Program, provides brand owners with a tool to easily report sellers and listings and have them removed within a 24-hour period.</p>
<p>Both schemes are making it more difficult for counterfeiters to ‘hide in plain sight’ on marketplaces but come complete with their own limitations. Project Zero, for example, is invite only and brands that do not own trademarks are not able to join. VeRO, on the other hand, is not an automated service and requires brand owners to manually find infringements of their IP on eBay’s marketplaces.</p>
<p>Counterfeiters now use a combination of social media platforms and marketplaces to continue their operations. Many social media platforms are vocally opposed to implementing filters that automatically check any content uploaded to the site for trademark or copyright infringement. Many do not have active brand protection programs to help brand owners root out infringers on their platform.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that there are a handful of social media platforms that have taken notice of the growing issue and implemented controls of their own for brand owners. These platforms mostly consist of those with transactional functions such as WeChat. WeChat’s Brand Protection Platform was first established in 2015 and is open to any brands.</p>
<h3>A growing government response to counterfeits</h3>
<p>Governments in traditionally high-risk counterfeiting regions have started to take greater action against platforms, websites and individual parties that facilitate or turn a blind eye to counterfeiting activity. Turning to regulation and new legislation instead of the reliance on self-regulation, governments are now placing platforms under greater scrutiny as the dominance of ecommerce platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba continues to grow.</p>
<p>January 2019 saw China’s new ecommerce law take effect, placing greater responsibility on platforms to take action against infringers. The legislation states that ecommerce platforms are now jointly accountable for facilitating the sale of counterfeits by third parties on their sites.</p>
<p>The Indian government is also taking steps to curtail bad actors online, recently publishing a draft ecommerce policy that includes regulation to combat counterfeiting and piracy. The policy mandates that ecommerce retailers must: register their business entity locally, inform legitimate brands that are being targeted by infringers and refund customers that receive counterfeit goods.</p>
<h4>Setbacks to government collaboration</h4>
<p>Concerningly for UK consumers and brands, Brexit may pose a risk to anti-counterfeiting efforts. In a no-deal scenario, the UK will lose access to EU-wide criminal databases [1] used by police and trading standards to coordinate offline anti-counterfeiting action such as raids and cargo seizure with EU partners. One such customs database is known as ‘COPIS’ (the anti-counterfeit and anti-piracy system), an information exchange system that supports IP protection for rights holders.</p>
<h2>Brands must take responsibility for protecting consumers</h2>
<p>Brands should welcome the strengthening of legislation and harness these new laws in their enforcement efforts. However, government and local authorities in many countries still maintain a very limited role in fighting counterfeits, with the detection and enforcement action often left to brands, even when consumer health is put at risk. This is compounded by the issue of disjointed collaboration between international authorities and is set to be exacerbated by events such as Brexit.</p>
<p>Additionally, current protections put in place by marketplaces do not cover the full spectrum of infringements and freeze out many brand owners who do not hold specific intellectual property rights. Ultimately, brands must take action to prevent the dissemination of counterfeits online.</p>
<p>Marketplaces obviously have a vested interest in both removing counterfeits that are damaging to consumer health and appeasing brands that have previously withdrawn from platforms due to infringement. However, by using platforms&#8217; tools alone to remove counterfeits, brand owners risk taking a ‘whack-a-mole’ approach. In order to effectively fight sophisticated counterfeiters, action needs to be at a network-scale to take down entire operations at once.</p>
