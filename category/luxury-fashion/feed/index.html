										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Protecting consumers and your reputation is critical to e-commerce success. A focused, deliberative strategy is needed to reduce infringement on key platforms and tackle large-scale criminal operators.</strong></p>



<p>We discuss how to prioritize and work with key platforms to reduce the volume of infringement. We then guide you through the tools at your disposal, allowing you to deliver against your Brand Protection goals.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-1-how-to-prioritize-platforms-to-review" style="color:#009ca6">Part 1: How to prioritize platforms to review</h2>



<p>It’s important to pick your battles and focus on&nbsp;threats that are&nbsp;most&nbsp;damaging to your brand&nbsp;and&nbsp;also&nbsp;where you are&nbsp;most&nbsp;likely to see ROI from your enforcement action.&nbsp;While Incopro discovers, prioritizes, and acts against infringements across platforms of all sizes, we find that over 80% of&nbsp;high-risk&nbsp;infringements occur&nbsp;on around 20 key platforms.</p>



<p>When&nbsp;determining your focus there are three key points to consider:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-1-protect-consumers-and-brand-value-eliminate-counterfeit-product-visible-to-potential-consumer">1. Protect consumers&nbsp;and brand value:&nbsp;eliminate counterfeit product visible to potential consumer&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Understand where your potential consumers shop.&nbsp;A good starting point is to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;key popular e-commerce platforms in each&nbsp;market&nbsp;and keep them clean from infringing product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep an eye on the emerging platforms: the way consumers shop online is constantly evolving.&nbsp;Social Commerce is not a new concept, but COVID-19 has really&nbsp;accelerated&nbsp;the process &#8211;&nbsp;2020 could be the year&nbsp;to watch as many&nbsp;social media&nbsp;platforms are&nbsp;investing in seamless&nbsp;commerce&nbsp;experiences.</p>



<h4 id="h-2-protect-your-own-e-commerce-channels-and-support-authorized-partners-eliminate-consumer-diversion-from-official-selling-channels">2. Protect your own e-commerce channels and support authorized partners: eliminate consumer diversion from official selling channels:&nbsp;</h4>



<p><strong>Protect Official Websites:</strong>&nbsp;the majority of&nbsp;consumers are likely arriving at your website via organic or paid searches for your brand&nbsp;and products. Focus&nbsp;on first pages of Search Engines&nbsp;and&nbsp;Paid Search&nbsp;results;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Official Social Media Channels:</strong> audit social media platforms to eliminate impersonating pages and ads that cause consumer confusion;</p>



<p><strong>Official and authorised Marketplace stores:</strong> focus on marketplace platforms where your brands have their own stores. Focus on top pages of results, top selling products and categories, sponsored listings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a good place to engage your e-commerce and marketing teams&nbsp;that are likely to be the first ones to see the benefits of your enforcement efforts and be advocates of your brand protection program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-3-tackle-the-source-of-the-problem">3. Tackle the source of the&nbsp;problem:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Focus on the platforms in the regions known for manufacturing counterfeits.&nbsp;B2B&nbsp;platforms and wholesalers are often the source of the counterfeit product ending up on the consumer facing markets.</p>



<h4 id="h-take-a-strategic-approach-to-platform-enforcement">Take a strategic approach to platform enforcement</h4>



<p>Concentrating&nbsp;enforcement&nbsp;efforts on priority platforms and&nbsp;priority&nbsp;concerns will lead to&nbsp;better Brand Protection outcomes. The more you focus on a platform and knock-out infringement networks, the more effective your enforcement will be, allowing you to establish an effective deterrent against them coming back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is best to carve out specific goals around specific platforms, brands, products, IP, infringement types, etc. and to try to tackle the specific problem fully with the aim of sending a clear, credible message to counterfeiters.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>A comparison of strategic enforcement versus non-strategic enforcement on 5 example platforms:</strong></p>

<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-2-how-to-prioritize-infringements-found-on-different-platforms" style="color:#009ca6">Part 2: How to prioritize infringements found on different platforms&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once you’ve narrowed down the focus of your Brand Protection program, you&nbsp;need to&nbsp;consider the strategy that will allow you to&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;balance the&nbsp;two aspects:&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-1-reduce-visibility-of-counterfeit-products-b2c">1. Reduce&nbsp;visibility of counterfeit products&nbsp;(B2C):&nbsp;</h4>



<ul><li>Infringing offers on first pages of results that divert attention from genuine product&nbsp;</li><li>Sponsored&nbsp;ads and&nbsp;listings&nbsp;as these are more likely to confuse the consumer&nbsp;</li><li>Good metrics:&nbsp;Some marketplaces platforms (e.g. eBay, AliExpress) share information on the number of transactions made on a listing. The offers with highest sales transactions are more likely to be visible to consumer.&nbsp;</li><li>Users and Sellers with high number of&nbsp;Likes, Favourites, and Followers&nbsp;have large audience and are more damaging&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-2-remove-large-scale-infringers-b2c-and-b2b">2. Remove&nbsp;large scale infringers&nbsp;(B2C and&nbsp;B2B):</h4>



<ul><li>Sellers with large volume of&nbsp;stock&nbsp;</li><li>Sellers with&nbsp;large&nbsp;numbers&nbsp;of&nbsp;infringing&nbsp;listings&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Sellers operating via multiple channels&nbsp;</li><li>Re-offenders</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-3-tips-for-working-with-the-e-commerce-giants-amazon-ebay-alibaba-facebook" style="color:#009ca6">Part 3:&nbsp;Tips for working with the e-commerce giants – Amazon, eBay, Alibaba &amp;&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;</h2>



<p>You need to work with the e-commerce and social media giants, plus other platforms, to get results.&nbsp;Most&nbsp;global&nbsp;platforms already have&nbsp;established processes and&nbsp;IP reporting tools available:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Amazon: Online Portal and Brand Registry&nbsp;together with other piloted projects like Amazon Project Zero&nbsp;</li><li>eBay:&nbsp;VeRO&nbsp;program&nbsp;</li><li>Alibaba IPP&nbsp;platform&nbsp;</li><li>Facebook&nbsp;has the webforms&nbsp;and Commerce and Ads IP tool&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>These tools allow brand owners and their agents to report such IP infringements&nbsp;as&nbsp;counterfeits and misuse of trademarks and copyright imagery. With time we see these tools evolve to address new infringer behavior with pressure from the brand owners.</p>



<p>Examples of this include the Facebook Commerce&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ads&nbsp;IP tool that identifies infringing ads on Facebook and Instagram and changes to the Amazon Brand Registry to address&nbsp;broader marketplace&nbsp;policy violations and introduce AI features to assist with proactive monitoring.</p>



<h4 id="h-platform-limitations">Platform limitations</h4>



<p>Unfortunately, these&nbsp;tools are not fully caught up to provide a&nbsp;robust&nbsp;response mechanism to emerging threats.</p>



<p>While the Amazon BR and Alibaba IPP tools are useful when it comes to sending out enforcements and getting items actioned quickly, they&nbsp;are not&nbsp;enough&nbsp;on their own because they do not provide robust capabilities for:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Collecting comprehensive data and getting&nbsp;visibility on the scale and types of problems on a platform.&nbsp;</li><li>Prioritization&#8211;organizing&nbsp;and grouping infringements for efficient&nbsp;enforcement;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Identifying infringement networks and recurring activity; and&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Maintaining records&nbsp;of the items that have been actioned&nbsp;and&nbsp;reporting.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Talisman, <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/difference/talisman-online-brand-protection/">Incopro’s Brand Protection platform</a>,&nbsp;is a complementary tool that ensures that brands have all the data they need related to infringements and a way to easily export material for efficient enforcement using the platform tools.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded has-text-color" id="h-part-4-how-to-address-new-threats-from-emerging-platforms" style="color:#009ca6">Part 4:&nbsp;How to address new threats from emerging platforms&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Social commerce is capturing demand for seamless consumer interactions, particularly from millennials and generation Z. Social media&nbsp;platforms are&nbsp;fast transforming from serving as a social marketing&nbsp;tool&nbsp;to&nbsp;e-commerce with users never having to leave the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The primary players in social commerce are Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook and now also&nbsp;TikTok.&nbsp;TikTok, for example,&nbsp;has started to allow some users to add links to e-commerce sites to their profile biography as well as the ability to easily send their viewers to shopping websites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumers are also being pushed to other platforms, including standalone e-commerce shops, such as Shopify which are easy to set up and maintain.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-strong-platform-relationships-are-essential">Strong platform relationships are essential</h4>



<p>Many platforms claim they are not in a position to police themselves, both in terms of labor and technology capabilities, and the burden is still on IP owners to report&nbsp;the infringements.&nbsp;Maintaining strong relationships with both established and emerging platforms is therefore critical to successfully reducing infringement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brands should engage with platforms regularly and have direct contact with their&nbsp;team to understand how they work, and&nbsp;to be able to provide feedback on what works well and what can improve. Compliance and platform response times improve when you take the time to educate the platform about your brands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see that infringers behavior is&nbsp;constantly&nbsp;evolving and&nbsp;they adopt to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;detection and&nbsp;enforcement.&nbsp;The ability to alert and advise platforms on these trends is essential to keeping up with bad actors.</p>



<p>When engaging emerging platforms, we suggest taking the following approach as part of your relationship building exercise:</p>



<ul><li>Identify relevant contacts: support and legal teams&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Educate&nbsp;the platforms&nbsp;about the risks&nbsp;posed by counterfeit&nbsp;products&nbsp;to the consumer and platform reputation&nbsp;</li><li>Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;best practices of&nbsp;what other platforms are doing&nbsp;</li><li>Consider cultural and business context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Engage in their own language&nbsp;if possible&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h2>



<ul type="1"><li><strong>Consider which&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;to&nbsp;tackle&nbsp;first based on where your consumers are, the volume of issues, your commercial objectives&nbsp;and how much impact you need to make to reduce your problem.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Engage with the platforms in a positive way, embrace their tools and&nbsp;give them&nbsp;feedback&nbsp;about&nbsp;where you would like to see them improve.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Keep an eye on the new and emerging platforms&nbsp;in case you need to add those to your top&nbsp;platform list.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>With the huge challenges facing all businesses as the world rapidly moves to online retail, consumer trust in digital channels is critical. There has never been a more important time to revisit how you approach protecting your brand and consumers on e-commerce platforms.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>
<h2>Black Friday and Cyber Monday, now worth a staggering US$14 billion<small class="rte-smalltext">[1]</small>, continue to be targeted by unscrupulous counterfeiters looking to exploit increased demand, and platforms are not doing enough to protect consumers and brands.</h2>
<p>Bad actors hide their fake products among genuine discounted goods, masking the suspiciously low pricing that consumers might associate with counterfeits. Even to the savviest of buyers, counterfeits become difficult to identify within a sea of constantly changing offers and flash-sales.</p>
<p>With up to 90% of consumers price checking a product on Amazon, even after finding it on a retailers’ page first[2], genuine sellers are immediately put at a disadvantage during sale events.</p>
<h3>Counterfeits increasingly offered to consumers in the run-up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h3>
<p>Increasingly, we see counterfeiters enrolling in pre-sale campaigns. Using Talisman, Incopro’s <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectiontechnology">online brand protection technology</a>, our analysts detected a spike in infringement activity for a premium<br><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Increase-in-counterfeiting-in-the-run-up-to-Black-Friday-1024x605.png" alt=""><br>footwear brand on Amazon in the run-up to Black Friday 2018<strong>. 24,257 high-risk listings</strong> were identified in November 2018 compared to 8,096 high-risk listings in October, representing an increase of almost <strong>300%.</strong> A high-risk listing is one that has been identified to likely be a counterfeit.</p>
<h4>Black Friday 2019 infringement:</h4>
<ul>
<li>eBay &#8211; <strong>15,989 high-risk listings</strong> were identified for a premium fashion brand in November, compared to 8,588 in October &#8211; representing an increase of <strong>86%.</strong></li>
<li>Amazon &#8211; <strong>562 high-risk listings</strong> were detected for a leading cosmetics brand in November, compared to 212 in October &#8211; revealing an increase of <strong>165%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in infringement is echoed on social media. For one luxury brand, our analysts discovered a <strong>233%</strong> increase in Instagram posts using the hashtag ‘#blackfriday’ to promote counterfeit watches during the four-week run-up.</p>
<h3>Dangerous fake toys sold to consumers through Amazon</h3>
<p>In 2014, fake versions of the <em>‘Mustachifier’ </em>branded baby pacifier were sold through Amazon. The product broke in two when used and led to a child in the US almost choking on the loose parts.</p>
<p>A separate incident in 2018 led to a child having parts of their colon removed after swallowing 13 tiny magnets from a Chinese copycat of a<em> ‘Magformers’</em> toy[3]. These fakes were widely available on Amazon and, even after being removed, it is unclear whether they were ever recalled.</p>
<p>Sellers aren&#8217;t required to provide any certification when listing children’s products on Amazon. The company only <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200292910?language=en-US">states</a> that &#8220;Sellers are responsible for tracking and complying with any regulations issued by the CPSC [Consumer Product Safety Commission]&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Counterfeiters exploit the Amazon ‘ASIN’</h3>
<p>The ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) is the unique offer identifier on Amazon, with each home to an individual product. Amazon requires brands to share ASINs with other sellers of the same product, but these sellers are not required to prove that their versions are legitimate.</p>
<p>Amazon algorithms favor top-selling and ‘best-value’ products. This helps counterfeit ASINs appear front and center.</p>
<h3>The Amazon buy box – a game of tug of war for brands</h3>
<p>82% of sales on Amazon are through the buy box[4]. The buy box contains the ‘buy now’ button and appears at the top of the Amazon listing. It is owned by only a single seller at any one time but will often change hands throughout the day.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amazon-buy-box-screenshot_small.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>Obtaining the buy box is an art-form which has been perfected by counterfeiters. With price a major determinant, Amazon algorithms favor counterfeiters over legitimate sellers who comply with minimum advertised prices (MAP) set by brands.<br><img src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amazon-Buy-box-criteria-exploited-by-counterfeiters.png" alt=""><br>The ruthless and fast-paced nature of the buy box offers the perfect battle ground for counterfeiters during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Counterfeiters discount their products to hijack the buy box for a short period, appearing legitimate to consumers during a sale event.</p>
<h3>Platforms slow to protect consumers during the holiday season</h3>
<p>Marketplaces are clearly vulnerable during the holiday season and are slow to react to increased levels of infringement, with some taking longer to remove counterfeit listings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“ eBay aims to remove counterfeit listings within 24 hours. However, this November we have noted that on some occasions the platform is taking up to 5 days to remove high-risk listings.”<br>&#8211; </strong>Katerina Pribanova, Incopro Brand Protection Sub-Team Leader</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A delay in removal can reduce its overall impact. If a counterfeit is only taken down after sale events have ended, the damage may have already been done.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, Incopro analysts have discovered that online enforcement forms on ‘Shopee’ (a marketplace notorious for counterfeits) have been disabled since November 26, possibly as a cynical attempt to reduce takedowns before this week’s sale events.</p>
<h3>What can brands do?</h3>
<p>It is essential that brands monitor infringement trends in the run-up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And as the phenomena continue to expand to new markets, they must look further afield too.</p>
<p>For each high-priority platform, you should have a comprehensive strategy in place. Our proposed strategy for Amazon during the holiday season is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monitor the buy box on your listings closely</li>
<li>Proactively defend your brand on Amazon by signing up to Brand Registry and ‘gate’ high-priority ASINs (the ASIN is the unique offer identifier on Amazon)</li>
<li>Monitor non-gated authorized ASINs and look for duplicates</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Amazon’s Brand Registry</strong> offers a number of tools to help brands manage their presence on the marketplace and to remove infringing products, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bulk enforcement of counterfeit ASINs</li>
<li>Merging duplicate ASINs</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><br>ASIN gating</strong> refers to the practice of ‘locking’ authorized ASINs so that only a select list of verified sellers can operate on it. Brands should be aware that it is only available to those enrolled in the Brand Registry. It is a paid service and is reserved for a select number of your listings.</p>
<p>As always, there are caveats. Brands require a trademark to register for the Brand Registry; those with design rights or other forms of IP are currently locked out of the program. Amazon also does not effectively police the Brand Registry across different regions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you will require sophisticated <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectiontechnology">Brand Protection technology</a> that can work in tandem with a platform’s own anti-counterfeiting tools.</p>
<h2>A Brand Protection solution</h2>
<p>Using brand protection technology, you will be able to <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#benefitsofbrandprotection">measure the impact of enforcement</a> and prioritize activity by region and risk.</p>

<p id="h-counterfeit-costumes-prone-to-catching-fire-and-fake-contact-lenses-that-can-damage-eyes-are-widely-available-online-in-the-run-up-to-halloween" style="font-size:24px"><strong>Counterfeit costumes prone to catching fire and fake contact lenses that can damage eyes are widely available online in the run-up to Halloween.</strong></p>



<p>Halloween spending is projected to be worth upwards of USD8.8 billion this year<small class="rte-smalltext">[1]</small> and is a prime target for counterfeiting operations online.</p>



<p>With marketplaces, eCommerce sites and social media awash with fake licensed goods and cosmetics in the run up to the festivities, consumers are being put at risk.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-counterfeiters-prey-on-seasonal-sales-and-holidays">Counterfeiters prey on seasonal sales and holidays </h2>



<p>Bad actors use targeted advertising on social media and promoted listings on marketplaces to offer their counterfeits to unsuspecting consumers. Ads offer counterfeit products a level of credibility, fooling many consumers into thinking they are purchasing goods sourced from official channels.</p>



<p>These scam sites often disappear without a trace after the seasonal demand drops-off, leaving consumers out of pocket and unable to replace their low-quality product in time for the festivities.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-fake-licensed-goods-haunting-marketplaces">Fake licensed goods haunting marketplaces </h2>



<p>Costumes and fancy dress are singled out by counterfeiters due to their increased demand, particularly during high profile seasonal events such as Halloween. Many of the products purchased this Halloween will be costumes, with a large percentage of these based on popular films, TV shows, video games, and comics.</p>



<p>Counterfeit costumes are made from low-quality materials and may easily tear. PIPCU warns that fake children’s costumes may even contain flammable materials, putting them at grave risk<small class="rte-smalltext">[3]</small>.</p>



<p>Brands must act; consumers spurned by counterfeits will direct the majority of their criticism at the brand rather than the platform. Incopro research finds that 66% of consumers who have been ripped off by fakes have lost trust in a brand after unintentionally purchasing counterfeit goods.</p>



<p>Identifying counterfeit or unlicensed costumes can be a difficult task for consumers. The following red flags should be widely communicated by brands to consumers:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Price</strong> &#8211; fake costumes are listed for prices as low as £3.99</li><li><strong>Typos or grammatical mistakes within the listing &#8211; </strong>spelling mistakes of the product or brand name are intentional to deceive consumers</li><li><strong>Seller address and item location – </strong>the listing may claim to be domestic stock but is actually shipped from overseas (or if the seller’s business address is registered overseas)</li></ul>



<h3>Examples of commonly counterfeited outfits this year</h3>



<p>Our analysts have identified a number of counterfeit and unlicensed costumes heading into Halloween. ‘Joker’ was released earlier this month and a quick scan of eBay revealed countless unlicensed costumes, with DC and Warner Bros. yet to release official merchandise for the record-breaking movie. IT Chapter 2 was released in September and faces a similar issue. The infringing listings are likely enforceable, with sellers using stills from the films (these images are protected by copyright) and registered trademarks without permission.</p>

<h3 id="h-counterfeit-cosmetics-tricking-consumers">Counterfeit cosmetics tricking consumers</h3>



<p>Cosmetics are also a popular target for bad actors. $69 million worth of fake cosmetic and pharmaceutical products were seized in the US in 2017, making up 6.5% of all counterfeit seizures.</p>



<p>Multi-colored lenses are often used as a finishing touch to Halloween costumes. Fake contact lenses are widely available, with PIPCU and the US government warning against their purchase.</p>



<h3 id="h-harmful-contact-lenses-available-at-halloween">Harmful contact lenses available at Halloween</h3>



<p>Counterfeit contact lenses are particularly dangerous as they can permanently damage a user’s eyes, either through incorrect usage (contact lenses are usually prescription only) or due to the materials used. Counterfeit contact lenses seized in the US earlier this year were found to contain lead[4].</p>



<p>Other fakes have been found to contain toxic materials such as cyanide, arsenic, lead, mercury and, in some cases, even rat excrement[5]. These harmful ingredients will cause skin irritation, rash or infection, and many are linked to a higher risk of cancer.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a><br>The warning signs of counterfeit products below should be well-communicated by brands to consumers:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Packaging &#8211; </strong>there are no pictures of the packaging or the listing states ‘without original packaging’,</li><li><strong>Use of stock photos with no photos of the product taken by the seller</strong></li></ul>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-so-how-can-brands-tackle-seasonal-threats">So, how can brands tackle seasonal threats?</h2>



<p>When brands rely solely on platform-tools to remove counterfeits, they risk falling into the trap of the ‘whack-a-mole’ approach.</p>



<p>Platforms can also be slow to respond to takedown requests. With time of the essence, this can be frustrating for brand owners who need listings removed before a seasonal event such as Halloween.</p>



<p>In order to effectively fight sophisticated counterfeiters, action needs to be at a network-scale and focused on taking down entire operations rather than individual listings.</p>



<h2 class="heading-branded" id="h-online-brand-protection-key-to-reducing-infringement">Online Brand Protection key to reducing infringement</h2>



<p>Brands must be prepared to face seasonal threats from online infringers; it is critical to factor in holidays, sales and other events throughout the year into your brand protection strategy. A brand should be proactive and flexible, monitoring problematic marketplaces and popular product lines.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Strong growth in the cosmetics market is attracting counterfeiters, with consumers being put at risk by fakes containing harmful materials such as arsenic, lead and rat excrement<small class="rte-smalltext">[1]</small>.</h2>
<p>Cosmetics sales are on the rise, with the industry recording growth of 5% in 2018 (its highest in two decades)<small class="rte-smalltext">[2]</small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a>. By 2024, the market is expected to be worth US$863 billion<small class="rte-smalltext">[3]</small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"></a>. Cosmetics are therefore seen as an enticing opportunity for counterfeiters looking to exploit consumer demand. Skincare is the leading category accounting for 36% of the global market<small class="rte-smalltext">[4]</small> and is seen as one of the most profitable avenues to bad actors.</p>
<p>Cosmetics and pharmaceutical products made up 6.5% of all counterfeit good seizures in the U.S. in 2017, estimated to be worth $69 million<small class="rte-smalltext">[5]</small>.</p>
<h3>The hidden dangers of counterfeit cosmetics</h3>
<p>Counterfeit cosmetics are often manufactured in unsanitary conditions where bacteria thrive. Seized goods have been found to contain toxic materials such as cyanide, arsenic, lead, mercury and, in some cases, even rat excrement. These harmful ingredients will cause skin irritation, rash or infection, and many are linked to a higher risk of cancer.<br /><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harmful-ingredients-in-counterfeit-cosmetics_RGB.png" alt="Seized goods have been found to contain toxic materials such as cyanide, arsenic, lead, mercury and, in some cases, even rat excrement. These harmful ingredients will cause skin irritation, rash or infection, and many are linked to a higher risk of cancer." width="520" height="266" /><br />Each cosmetic good must detail its ingredients within the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) to ensure regulatory compliance. To avoid detection by more savvy consumers, counterfeiters display the INCI list of the official product. This, in turn, masks the true ingredients from the consumer, putting them at risk of coming into contact with these dangerous ingredients.</p>
<h3>The rise of social media selling and the risks posed</h3>
<p>The skincare market accelerated dramatically in 2018, with the industry crediting this to the expansion of the &#8216;upper middle classes’ globally and, most specifically, in Asia.</p>
<p>Many high-end brands are engaged in a fierce battle for online popularity with this upper middle class. MAC Cosmetics leads the charge with their social media following on Twitter and Instagram. Whereas Eisenberg Paris has the largest social real estate on Facebook<small class="rte-smalltext">[4]</small>.</p>
<p>Social media has given rise to fast-moving influencer brands such as Jeffree Star and Zoella. It is also integral to start-up brands, who rely heavily on influencers and sponsorships to quickly build brand recognition in a market that is fast reaching saturation.</p>
<p>Each of these cosmetics brands communicate with their customers through social media and official websites. Unfortunately for brands, counterfeiters are also highly active on social media; infringers have moved to where consumers now make purchasing decisions, advertising their fake goods within paid ads and sponsored posts on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. These ads offer fakes a level of credibility, fooling many consumers into thinking they are genuine goods.</p>
<p>Bad actors place text within images and use obscured product photos and brand imagery to avoid detection by brands. They increasingly avoid using trademarks to further throw legal teams off the scent.</p>
<h3>The dark side of grey market marketplaces and third-party resellers</h3>
<p>The global popularity of online third-party retailers who regularly discount cosmetic goods, such as Sephora and Ulta and individual marketplaces such as Wish, has caused headaches for brands. Whilst legitimate products are available on these marketplaces, they also play host to a wide range of counterfeit or grey market products that are not fit for use.</p>
<p>FragranceNet is a platform operating in the grey market space that offers ‘vintage’, out of stock, discontinued and discounted luxury perfumes. The platform has been accused of selling used or opened perfumes by customer reviews, and in some cases, is believed to have sold counterfeits.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.incoproip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FragranceNet-review_1.png" alt="FragranceNet has been accused of selling used or opened perfumes by customer reviews, and in some cases, is believed to have sold counterfeits." width="750" height="294" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><small class="rte-smalltext"><em>Recent customer review of FragranceNet on Consumeraffairs.com</em></small></p>
<p>Wish is another marketplace that has hit headlines by selling counterfeit makeup. The platform has a mostly young, middle-class customer base with a gross merchandise value estimated at US$5.5 billion. The marketplace has come under great scrutiny after it emerged last year that a 41-year-old woman purchased counterfeit Urban Decay and MAC products. The fake eyeshadow powder received reportedly smelt sulfuric and when it was applied to the customer’s right eye, the surrounding skin reacted and eventually became infected<small class="rte-smalltext">[6]</small>.</p>
<h2>Targeted enforcement and social media monitoring essential</h2>
<p>Brands must act to ensure that consumers are protected online. Case law exists for brands operating in the pharmaceutical and medical device markets who have been deemed to be aware of black or grey market goods but have taken insufficient action. This legal reasoning could be applied to a cosmetics brand if it was found to have not put sufficient anti-counterfeiting and authentication steps in place or not warned consumers of the dangers of buying fakes. They may also be found liable for injuries to consumers as a result of purchasing counterfeits.</p>
<p>So, what can brands do about this growing threat?</p>
<p>It is key to regain control of the social media environment to affect a lasting reduction in infringement. Social media advertising monitoring technology, targeted enforcement and robust platform relationships are essential components of a <a href="https://www.incoproip.com/reports/brand-protection-guide#brandprotectionstrategy">comprehensive Online Brand Protection strategy</a> that can achieve this.</p>
